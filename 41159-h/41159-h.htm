<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<div class='cap'>SOME time ago a Naval Officer who was
engaged on particularly hazardous duty
was discussing calmly the chances that he
and his like had of surviving the war, assuming
that it continued for several more years
and that his particular branch of it increased
its intensity. He wound up his remarks by
saying, "The chief reason why I particularly
want to survive the finish is that I'm so keen
on comparing notes with our opposite members
in the German Navy."</div>

<p>That is the answer to those who ask, as an
important official gentleman asked recently,
why this English translation of Rittmeister
von Richthofen's book should be published.
It gives our flying people an opportunity of
comparing notes with one of Germany's
star-turn fighting pilots, just as that excellent
book by "Contact" gives the Germans
the chance of gathering the atmosphere of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the Royal Flying Corps as it was in 1916
and 1917.</p>

<p>"The Red Battle-Flyer" has evidently been
carefully censored by the German authorities.
Also it has possibly been touched up
here and there for propagandist purposes.
Consequently, although the narrative as it
stands is extraordinarily interesting, the
book as a whole is still more interesting on
account of what one reads between the lines,
and of what one can deduce from the general
outlook of the writer. There is, perhaps,
little to learn of immediate topical interest,
but there is much that explains things which
were rather difficult to understand in the
past, and the understanding of such points
gives one a line of reasoning which should
be useful to our active-service aviators in
the future.</p>

<p>When one makes due allowance for the
propagandist nature of the book, which gives
one the general impression of the writing
of a gentleman prepared for publication by
a hack journalist, one forms a distinctly favorable
mental picture of the young Rittmeister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Baron von Richthofen. Our old
friend Froissart is credited with the statement
that in his age of chivalry it was
always "impossible to inculcate into the
German knights the true spirit of knightliness."
Which seems to indicate that the
practical German mind of those days could
not understand the whimsicalities of the
Latin ideas of chivalry, which&mdash;for example&mdash;bade
a knight against whose shield an
opponent "brake his spear" haul off out of
the fight till the lance-less enemy unsheathed
his sword and "drave into the combat" again.
Probably the Hun of those days proceeded
to stick his opponent in the midriff&mdash;wherever
it may be&mdash;and so finished the fight.</p>

<p>In the same true spirit of knightliness an
Englishman knocks a man down and then
stands back so that he can get up and have
another chance, whereas a more practical
person would take excellent care that his
opponent never got up till he had acknowledged
himself beaten. It is all a matter of
the point of view, and largely no doubt a
matter of education. However, making due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
allowance for the point of view, one finds
surprisingly little Hunnishness in von Richthofen's
manners or methods as set forth in
print.</p>

<p>It is one of the accepted facts of the war
that the German aviators have displayed
greater chivalry than any other branch of
the German services. It was a common
occurrence for their pilots to fly over our
lines in the course of their business, and, by
way of variety from that business, to drop
packets containing letters from captured
British aviators, or the personal belongings
of the dead. One gathers that these acts of
courtesy have become less frequent of late,
owing to the intensification of aerial warfare,
but it seems that captured and killed
aviators still receive the full courtesies of
war from the German aviators, whatever
may be the fate of prisoners in other hands
afterwards.</p>

<p>It is not surprising therefore to find that,
taking him all round, Rittmeister von Richthofen
conveys to one the general impression
that, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, he is very like an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
English public school boy of good family.
His egotism, as one finds it in the book, is
the egotism of a young man who is frankly
pleased with himself, but is more elated by
his good luck than by his cleverness.</p>

<p>Taking him by and large, one rather likes
von Richthofen, and one fancies that most
of the R.F.C. people who have fought him
would be quite pleased after the war to sit
at table with him and compare notes over
the cigarettes and liquors, as my Naval
friend wants to do with his pre-war friends
of the German Navy. And there are unhappily
not too many of our present enemies
of whom one would like to express such an
opinion.</p>

<p>When one comes to read into the book one
begins to find many interesting things
about the German Army, and the war in
general, as well as about the German Feldfliegertruppen&mdash;or
Flying Service. The German
is not really a skilful censor. Just as
certain portraits painted by an artist at
Ruhleben conveyed by the expression of the
faces a good deal that Germany would like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
hidden, so von Richthofen's book, though
carefully censored, lets out quite a good deal
of information.</p>

<p>The first thing that strikes one is that
Germany's standing army at the beginning
of the war was nothing like so perfect a
fighting machine as we in this country believed.
Although, like all the people with
any sense in this country, the German Army
knew that a war was coming, the officers
and men seem to have set about their work
in a singularly amateurish way, judging by
the short section of the book devoted to the
opening of the war on the Russian Front.
And one is pleased to find that von Richthofen
has the grace to laugh at himself and
his brother-officers for their mistakes.</p>

<p>In some ways the soldiers of all nations
resemble one another strongly. For instance,
one finds in this book the same contempt
for what the Germans picturesquely
call a "base-hog," as the French have for
the "embusqu&eacute;" and as the British front-line
officer has for the young and able-bodied
officer who is "Something on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Staff." This obnoxious breed is the same
in all armies, and must be clearly distinguished
from the carefully trained and expensively
educated General Staff Officer,
who is very much of a specialist and is the
very brain of the Army.</p>

<p>When we come to the purely aviatic portion
of the book one finds more of the real
von Richthofen and less of the cavalry
officer. His honesty about his utter mental
confusion the first time he went into the air
recalls General Brancker's famous remark
in his lecture to the Aeronautical Society
when he said that no one ever sees anything
at all during his first hour in the air owing
to the hopeless confusion in his mind caused
by the novel aspect of everything. Von
Richthofen's description of his experience is
about the best thing that has been written
on the subject.</p>

<p>An interesting bit of information is disclosed
in his description of his flight in a
"Grossflugzeug," on September 1st, 1915.
At that period little was known about twin-engined
aeroplanes. The Germans were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
known to have tried them, but they were
not a success. The only example known to
our people&mdash;though probably there were
actually several different machines&mdash;was
commonly known in the R.F.C. as "Wong-wong,"
on account of the curious noise made
by the engines or air-screws when they got
"out of phase"&mdash;as an electrician might
call it. This noise is now quite familiar to
the inhabitants of Southeastern England
as the characteristic note of the Gotha
bombers.</p>

<p>Von Richthofen's good judgment of fighting
values, though he was then only an
observer, and a novice at that, is shown by
his disapproval of the twin-engined aeroplane
as a fighting machine. It is also of
interest to learn that at that period the
Germans had tried an auto-lock device to
hold the rudder of a twin-engined machine
over to one side so that it would fly straight
if one engine went out of action, an ingenious
idea even if foredoomed to failure.</p>

<p>It is encouraging to find that though
these twin-engined machines were in operation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in September, 1915, the first bombing
squadron so composed only came into action
against defenceless Bucharest a year later.
This shows that actually we in this country
are not so very much slower in producing
our new ideas, for our big Handley Page
twin-engined biplanes first flew towards the
end of 1915, and we began to use them regularly
early in 1917&mdash;only a little more than
a year later.</p>

<p>The similarity of aviators in all countries
is shown by von Richthofen's frank confession
of blue funk when he made his first
flight alone. That first solo is always the
most anxious time in a pilot's career. Another
touch of that nature which makes all
aviators akin is seen in his accounts of how
he and other pupils under instruction used
to fly off on cross-country training trips and
suffer from opportune forced landings in the
parks of their friends or in likely-looking
estates. One imagined that this manifestation
of "wongling" was an essentially English
trick, and would not have been tolerated
for a moment under the iron discipline of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the German Army. In the early days of the
R.F.C. this looking for opulent hosts used
to be known sarcastically as "hunting for
Jew-palaces."</p>

<p>The state of affairs on the Russian front
is well shown in the brief reference in the
book. "Flying in the East is absolutely a
holiday," says the writer, who adds that
there was no danger on the Russian front,
except the danger of being massacred by the
Russians if brought down by engine failure.
From which one understands that the Russians
did not approve of making prisoners
of enemy aviators. Their "Archies" were
apparently good, but too few to be useful,
and their aviators practically did not exist.
Which is rather what one ventured to surmise
in print at the time, despite the magniloquent
Russian communiqu&eacute;s. When one
thinks of all the good British and French
aeroplanes and engines which were sent to
Russia one regrets the waste of material.</p>

<p>On the subject of air fighting, von Richthofen
is always worth studying carefully.
None will dispute his wisdom in laying stress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
on the importance of calmness in an air
fight. We have lost many good fighting
pilots through their getting excited and
dashing headlong into an unequal combat.
He, or his editor, has been sufficiently skilful
not to give away his pet method of
attack. However, one gathers that he depended
largely on his first rush for his results,
rather than on a prolonged series of
manoeuvres.</p>

<p>His dictum that "in air fighting results
depend on ability and not on trickery,"
rather bears out this impression. Nevertheless
he occasionally tells of a lengthy tussle
with a particularly skilful enemy.</p>

<p>Such a story relates how that very gallant
gentleman, Major Lanoe Hawker, one of the
best loved and admired of the R.F.C.'s many
gallant fighting leaders, fell. It would seem
that Major Hawker's machine was outclassed
rather than that he was beaten by
superior skill. One is glad to find that von
Richthofen pays a tribute to the bravery and
ability of his enemy, and it is perhaps some
slight consolation to those of us who knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Lanoe Hawker to think that he fell a victim
to the Germans' best man and not to a
chance shot from an unworthy foe.</p>

<p>It is rather curious that some time after
emphasizing the fact that trickery does not
pay in air fighting, von Richthofen should
show how trickery does pay by describing his
young brother Lothar's trick of pretending
to be shot and letting his machine fall apparently
out of control, so as to break off a fight
with opponents who were above his weight.
One is inclined to wonder how many optimistic
young air-fighters have reported
enemy machines as "driven down out of control,"
when in reality the wily Hun has only
been getting out of the way of harm. The
older hands in these days are not easily
caught by such a trick, and the High Command
refuses to count any victims so claimed
unless the performance is verified by independent
witnesses either on the ground or
aloft.</p>

<p>Another point of interest in von Richthofen's
fighting methods is that he states,
that as a rule, he opens fire at 50 yards. Distances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
are hard to judge in the air. The pilot
is more likely to underestimate them than
otherwise, just as one does in judging distances
at sea. But von Richthofen is probably
as good a judge as any, and in this he
seems to be stating a plain fact. In these
days 50 yards is fairly long range. Some of
our own crack fighters prefer 50 feet, if they
can get into their favorite positions. Anyhow
he shows the unwisdom of opening fire
at 1,000 yards, as some inexperienced and
excited machine-gunners are rather apt
to do.</p>

<p>Von Richthofen's chaser squadron&mdash;or
Jagdstaffel, as the Germans call these formations&mdash;was
the first to be known as a
"circus." The famous Boelcke squadron,
although a fairly mobile body, the members
of which co-operated closely on occasion,
never developed formation fighting to the
extent that von Richthofen did.</p>

<p>His men, although, as the book shows,
they went out periodically on lone-hand
ventures, generally flew in a body, numbering
anywhere from half a dozen to fifteen or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
so. Their leader chose to paint his little
Albatros a brilliant pillar-box red. The
others painted their machines according to
their fancy. Some had yellow noses, blue
bodies and green wings. Some were pale
blue underneath and black on top. Some
were painted in streaks, some with spots.
In fact, they rang the changes on the whole
of the paint-box.</p>

<p>They flew wonderfully, being all picked
men, and in a fight they performed in a manner
which would have seemed impossible to
the most expert aerial acrobats.</p>

<p>Also, the squadron was moved from place
to place as a self-contained unit, so that it
appeared wherever the fighting was thickest,
or wherever British or French reconnaissance
machines were busiest. It would
be operating at Verdun one week. The next
week it would be north of Arras. A few
days later it would be down on the Somme.
But as a rule it specialized on the British
front. Wherever it pitched its tents it did
its regular squadron performance, and followed
it later in the day with lone-hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
raids, or "strafing" flight by two or three
machines at a time.</p>

<p>When one considers the harlequin coloring
of the machines, their acrobatic flying and
their "two shows a day" performances from
their one-week pitches, it follows logically
that the humorists of the R.F.C. simply had
to call the squadron "von Richthofen's
Traveling Circus."</p>

<p>Since then the word has acquired a meaning
of its own among flying men. It connotes
practically any special formation organized
for the purpose of hunting enemy
aviators, and consisting of picked men under
a specially skilful leader. It need not necessarily
be more mobile than any other squadron,
and it need not indulge in freak colorings,
though in the nature of its work, its
flying must be acrobatic. The British "circuses"
are in these days superior to the German
circuses, because our machines are now
at least as good as those of the Germans, and
so our men, who have always been of higher
average quality than the German aviators,
have a fair chance of proving their worth.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Of those of von Richthofen's circus mentioned
in the book, Sch&auml;fer was the first to
be killed. Before the war he lived in London,
to learn English, working in an office
in the city, when so inclined, but mostly
spending his time on the river, or in sport.
Those who knew him say that he was a
pleasant lad and a good sportsman.</p>

<p>Voss was the next to go, after what has
been described by those who were in it as
one of the most gallant fights of the war.
On a Fokker triplane with a French le
Rhone engine&mdash;evidently an experimental
machine built for quick manoeuvring&mdash;he
fought single-handed a patrol of six of our
people, when he could have broken off the
fight and have got away by abandoning an
inferior companion. He was a brave man
and a most brilliant pilot. His flying and
shooting in his last fight are said to have
been marvelously clever. None admire his
bravery more than those who fought him.</p>

<p>Others of the "circus" have fallen since
then, and the present "Richthofen Jagdstaffel"
is probably constituted very differently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
from that band of high-spirited desperadoes
which was evolved from the original
Boelcke squadron, and helped to build up
the fame of von Richthofen. There is none
of the old R.F.C. who would not cheerfully
kill what is left of the "circus," and there is
probably none who would not gladly shake
hands with the survivors after peace is declared.
They are worthy enemies and brave
men.</p>

<p>This little book gives one a useful insight
into the enemy's methods, and more than a
little respect for at any rate some of those
whom we are at present endeavoring to kill.</p>

<h2>I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><i>My Family.</i></div>


<div class='cap'>THE members of my family&mdash;that of
Richthofen&mdash;have taken no very great
part in wars until now. The Richthofens
have always lived in the country; indeed,
there has scarcely been one of them without
a landed estate, and the few who did
not live in the country have, as a rule, entered
the State service. My grandfather
and all my ancestors before him had estates
about Breslau and Striegau. Only in the
generation of my grandfather it happened
that the first Richthofen, his cousin, became
a General.</div>

<p>My mother belongs to the family Von
Schickfuss und Neudorf. Their character
resembles that of the Richthofen people.
There were a few soldiers in that family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
All the rest were agrarians. The brother of
my great-grandfather Schickfuss fell in 1806.
During the Revolution of 1848 one of the
finest castles of a Schickfuss was burnt
down. The Schickfuss have, as a rule, only
become Captains of the Reserve.</p>

<p>In the family Schickfuss and in the family
Falckenhausen&mdash;my grandmother's maiden
name was Falckenhausen&mdash;there were two
principal hobbies: horse riding and game
shooting. My mother's brother, Alexander
Schickfuss, has done a great deal of game
shooting in Africa, Ceylon, Norway and
Hungary.</p>

<p>My father is practically the first member
of our branch of the family to become a
professional soldier. At an early age he
entered the Corps of Cadets and later
joined the 12th Regiment of Uhlans. He
was the most conscientious soldier imaginable.
He began to suffer from difficulty of
hearing and had to resign. He got ear
trouble because he saved one of his men
from drowning and though he was wet
through and through he insisted upon continuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
his duties as if nothing had happened,
wet as he was, without taking notice
of the rigor of the weather. The present
generation of the Richthofens contains, of
course, many more soldiers. In war every
able-bodied Richthofen is, of course, on
active service. In the very beginning of the
present war I lost six cousins, and all were
in the cavalry.</p>

<p>I was named after my uncle Manfred,
who in peace time, was adjutant to His
Majesty and Commander of the Corps of
the Guards. During the war he has been
Commander of a Corps of Cavalry.</p>

<p>My father was in the 1st Regiment of
Cuirassiers in Breslau when I was born on
the 2nd of May, 1892. We then lived at
Kleinburg. I received tuition privately until
my ninth year. Then I went for a year to
school in Schweidnitz and then I became
Cadet in Wahlstatt. The people of Schweidnitz
considered me as one of themselves.
Having been prepared for a military career
as a Cadet, I entered the 1st Regiment of
Uhlans.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>My own adventures and experiences will
be found in this book.</p>

<p>My brother, Lothar, is the other flying-man
Richthofen. He wears the <i>Ordre pour
le M&eacute;rite</i>. My youngest brother is still in
the Corps of Cadets and he is waiting
anxiously until he is old enough to go on
active service. My sister, like all the ladies
of our family, is occupied in nursing the
wounded.</p>


<div class='section'>
My Life as a Cadet<br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>AS a little boy of eleven I entered the
Cadet Corps. I was not particularly
eager to become a Cadet, but my father
wished it. So my wishes were not consulted.</div>

<p>I found it difficult to bear the strict discipline
and to keep order. I did not care
very much for the instruction I received.
I never was good at learning things. I did
just enough work to pass. In my opinion it
would have been wrong to do more than was
just sufficient, so I worked as little as possible.
The consequence was that my teachers
did not think overmuch of me. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
other hand, I was very fond of sport. Particularly
I liked gymnastics, football, and
other outdoor amusements. I could do all
kinds of tricks on the horizontal bar. For
this I received various prizes from the Commander.</p>

<p>I had a tremendous liking for all risky
foolery. For instance, one fine day, with my
friend Frankenberg, I climbed the famous
steeple of Wahlstatt by means of the lightning
conductor and tied my handkerchief to
the top. I remember exactly how difficult
it was to negotiate the gutters. Ten years
later, when I visited my little brother at
Wahlstatt, I saw my handkerchief still tied
up high in the air.</p>

<p>My friend Frankenberg was the first
victim of the war as far as I know.</p>

<p>I liked very much better the Institution
of Lichterfelde. I did not feel so isolated
from the world and began to live a little
more like a human being.</p>

<p>My happiest reminiscences of Lichterfelde
are those of the great sports when my
opponent was Prince Frederick Charles. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Prince gained many first prizes against me
both in running and football, as I had not
trained my body as perfectly as he had done.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>I Enter the Army. (Easter, 1911)</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>OF course, I was very impatient to get into
the Army. Immediately after passing
my examination I came forward and was
placed in the 1st Regiment of Uhlans, "Emperor
Alexander III." I had selected that
regiment. It was garrisoned in my beloved
Silesia and I had some acquaintances and
relations there, who advised me to join it.</div>

<p>I had a colossal liking for the service with
my regiment. It is the finest thing for a
young soldier to be a cavalry man.</p>

<p>I can say only little about the time which
I passed at the War Academy. My experience
there reminds me too much of the
Corps of Cadets and consequently my
reminiscences are not over agreeable.</p>

<p>I remember that once one of my teachers
bought a very fat mare, an amiable animal,
whose only fault was that she was rather
old. She was supposed to be fifteen years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
old. She had rather stout legs, but she
jumped splendidly. I rode her frequently,
and her name was Biffy.</p>

<p>About a year later, when I joined the regiment,
my Captain, von Tr&mdash;&mdash;, who was very
fond of sport, told me that he had bought
a funny little mare, a fat beast, who jumped
very nicely. We all were very interested
to make the acquaintance of the fat jumping
horse who bore the strange name Biffy. I
had quite forgotten the old mare of my
teacher at the War Academy. One fine
morning, the animal arrived and I was astonished
to find that the ancient Biffy was
now standing as an eight-year-old in the
Captain's stable. In the meantime, she had
changed her master repeatedly, and had
much risen in value. My teacher had bought
her for $375., as a fifteen-year-old, and von
Tr&mdash;&mdash; had bought her a year later, as an
eight-year-old, for $850. She won no more
prizes for jumping, in spite of her renewed
youth, but she changed her master once
more and was killed in action in the beginning
of the war.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>


<div class='section'>
<i>I Become an Officer. (Autumn, 1912)</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>AT last I was given the epaulettes. It
was a glorious feeling, the finest I have
ever experienced when people called me
Lieutenant.</div>

<p>My father bought me a beautiful mare
called Santuzza. It was a marvelous animal,
as hard as nails. She kept her place in the
procession like a lamb. In course of time
I discovered that she possessed a great talent
for jumping and I made up my mind to train
her. She jumped incredible heights.</p>

<p>In this enterprise I got much sympathy
and co-operation from my comrade von
Wedel, who won many a prize with his
charger, Fandango.</p>

<p>We two trained our horses for a jumping
competition and a steeplechase in Breslau.
Fandango did gloriously. Santuzza also did
well by taking a great deal of trouble. I
hoped to achieve something with her. On
the day before she was to be put on the
train I wished once more to jump all the
obstacles in our training ground. In doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
so we slipped. Santuzza hurt her shoulder
and I broke my collar-bone.</p>

<p>I expected that my dear fat mare, Santuzza,
would also be a quick runner and was
extremely surprised when she was beaten
by Wedel's thoroughbred.</p>

<p>Another time I had the good fortune to
ride a very fine horse at a Sports Meeting
at Breslau. My horse did extremely well
and I had hopes of succeeding. After a run
of about half the course I approached the
last obstacle. At a long distance I saw that
the obstacle in front was bound to be something
extraordinary because a great crowd
was watching near it. I said to myself:
"Keep your spirits up. You are sure to get
into trouble." I approached the obstacle,
going full speed. The people about waved
to me and shouted that I should not go so
fast, but I neither heard nor saw. My horse
jumped over and on the other side there was
a steep slope with the river Weistritz in
front. Before I could say <i>knife</i> the horse,
having jumped, fell with a gigantic leap into
the river and horse and rider disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Of course, I was thrown over the head of the
animal. Felix got out of the river on the
one side and I on the other. When I came
back, the weighing people were surprised
that I had put on ten pounds instead of losing
two pounds as usual. Happily no one
noticed that I was wet through and through.</p>

<p>I had also a very good charger. The unfortunate
beast had learned to do everything&mdash;running,
steeplechasing, jumping,
army service. There was nothing that the
poor beast had not learned. Its name was
Blume and I had some pleasant successes
with him. The last prize I got riding that
horse was when I rode for the Kaiser Prize
in 1913. I was the only one who got over
the whole course without a single slip. In
doing so I had an experience which cannot
easily be repeated. In galloping over a piece
of heath land, I suddenly stood on my head.
The horse had stepped into a rabbit hole and
in my fall I broke my collar-bone. Notwithstanding
the breakage, I rode another forty
miles without making a mistake and arrived
keeping good time.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>




<h2>II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><i>The Outbreak of War</i></div>


<div class='cap'>ALL the papers contained nothing but
fantastic stories about the war. However,
for several months we had been accustomed
to war talk. We had so often
packed our service trunks that the whole
thing had become tedious. No one believed
any longer that there would be war. We,
who were close to the frontier, who were
"the eyes of the Army," to use the words of
my Commander, believed least that there
would be war.</div>

<p>On the day before military preparations
began we were sitting with the people of
the detached squadron at a distance of ten
kilometres from the frontier, in the officers'
club. We were eating oysters, drinking
champagne and gambling a little. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
very merry. No one thought of war.</p>

<p>It is true that, some days before, Wedel's
mother had startled us a little. She had arrived
from Pomerania in order to see her son
before the beginning of the war. As she
found us in the pleasantest mood and as she
ascertained that we did not think of war,
she felt morally compelled to invite us to a
very decent luncheon.</p>

<p>We were extremely gay and noisy when
suddenly the door opened. It disclosed
Count Kospoth, the Administrator of Ols.
He looked like a ghost.</p>

<p>We greeted our old friend with a loud
Hoorah! He explained to us the reason of
his arrival. He had come personally to the
frontier in order to convince himself whether
the rumors of an impending world-war were
true. He assumed, quite correctly, that the
best information could be obtained at the
frontier. He was not a little surprised when
he saw our peaceful assembly. We learned
from him that all the bridges in Silesia were
being patrolled by the military and that steps
were being taken to fortify various positions.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>We convinced him quickly that the possibility
of war was absolutely nil and continued
our festivity.</p>

<p>On the next day we were ordered to take
the field.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>We Cross the Frontier</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>TO us cavalry men on the frontier the
word "war" had nothing unfamiliar.
Everyone of us knew to the smallest detail
what to do and what to leave undone. At
the same time, nobody had a very clear idea,
what the first thing would be. Every
soldier was delighted to be able to show his
capacity and his personal value.</div>

<p>We young cavalry Lieutenants had the
most interesting task. We were to study
the ground, to work towards the rear of the
enemy, and to destroy important objects.
All these tasks require real men.</p>

<p>Having in my pocket my directions and
having convinced myself of their importance,
through hard study during at least a
year, I rode at the head of a file of soldiers
for the first time against the enemy at
twelve o'clock midnight.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>A river marks the frontier and I expected
to be fired upon on reaching it. To my astonishment
I could pass over the bridge
without an incident. On the next morning,
without having had any adventures, we
reached the church tower of the village of
Kieltze, which was well known to us through
our frontier rides.</p>

<p>Everything had happened without seeing
anything of the enemy or rather without
being seen by him. The question now was
what should I do in order not to be noticed
by the villagers? My first idea was to lock
up the "pope"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. We fetched him from his
house, to his great surprise. I locked him
up among the bells in the church tower, took
away the ladder and left him sitting up
above. I assured him that he would be executed
if the population should show any
hostile inclinations. A sentinel placed on the
tower observed the neighborhood.</p>

<p>I had to send reports every day by dispatch-riders.
Very soon my small troop
was converted entirely into dispatch-riders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and dissolved, so that I had at last, as the
only one remaining, to bring in my own
report.</p>

<p>Up to the fifth night everything had been
quiet. During that night the sentinel came
suddenly rushing to the church tower near
which the horses had been put. He called
out, "The Cossacks are there!" The night
was as dark as pitch. It rained a little. No
stars were visible. One couldn't see a yard
ahead.</p>

<p>As a precaution we had previously
breached the wall around the churchyard.
Through the breach we took the horses into
the open. The darkness was so great that
we were in perfect security after having advanced
fifty yards. I myself went with the
sentinel, carbine in hand, to the place where
he pretended he had seen Cossacks.</p>

<p>Gliding along the churchyard wall I came
to the street. When I got there I experienced
a queer feeling, for the street swarmed
with Cossacks. I looked over the wall, behind
which the rascals had put the horses.
Most of them had lanterns, and they acted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
very uncautiously and were very loud. I estimated
that there were from twenty to thirty
of them. One had left his horse and gone to
the Pope whom I had let off the day before.</p>

<p>Immediately it flashed through my brain:
"Of course we are betrayed!" Therefore,
we had to be doubly careful. I could not
risk a fight because I could not dispose of
more than two carbines. Therefore, I resolved
to play at robber and police.</p>

<p>After having rested a few hours, our
visitors rode away again.</p>

<p>On the next day I thought it wise to
change our quarters. On the seventh day
I was again back in my garrison and everyone
stared at me as if I were a ghost. The
staring was not due to my unshaved face,
but because there had been a rumor that
Wedel and I had fallen at Kalisch. The
place where it had occurred, the time and all
the circumstances of my death had been reported
with such a wealth of detail that the
report had spread throughout Silesia. My
mother had already received visits of condolence.
The only thing that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
omitted was an announcement of my death
in the newspaper.</p>

<p>An amusing incident happened about the
same time. A veterinary surgeon had been
ordered to take ten Uhlans and to requisition
horses on a farm. The farm was situated
about two miles from the road. He
came back full of excitement and reported
to us:</p>

<p>"I was riding over a stubble field, the field
where the scarecrows are, when I suddenly
saw hostile infantry at a distance. Without
a moment's hesitation I drew my sword
and ordered the Uhlans to attack them with
their lances. The men were delighted and
at the fastest gallop they rushed across the
field. When we came near the enemy I discovered
that the hostile infantry consisted
of some deer which were grazing in a nearby
meadow. At that distance I had mistaken
them for soldiers, owing to my shortsightedness."</p>

<p>For a long time that dear gentleman had
to suffer the pleasantries of the rest of us
because of his bold attack.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>


<div class='section'>
<i>To France</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>WE were ordered to take the train in
my garrison town. No one had any
idea in what direction we were to go.</div>

<p>There were many rumors but most of the
talk was very wild. However, in this present
case, we had the right idea: westward.</p>

<p>A second-class compartment had been
given to four of us. We had to take in
provisions for a long railway journey.
Liquid refreshments, of course, were not
lacking. However, already on the first day
we discovered that a second-class compartment
is altogether too narrow for four war-like
youths. Therefore, we resolved to distribute
ourselves. I arranged part of a
luggage car and converted it into a bed-drawing
room, to my great advantage. I
had light, air, and plenty of space. I procured
straw at one of the stations and put
a tent cloth on top of it. In my improvised
sleeping-car I slept as well as I did in my
four-poster in Ostrowo. We traveled night
and day, first through Silesia, and then
through Saxony, going westward all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
time. Apparently we were going in the
direction of Metz. Even the train conductor
did not know where he was going to. At
every station, even at stations where we did
not stop, there were huge crowds of men
and women who bombarded us with cheers
and flowers. The German nation had been
seized by a wild war enthusiasm. That was
evident. The Uhlans were particularly admired.
The men in the train who had passed
through the station before us had probably
reported that we had met the enemy, and
we had been at war only for a week. Besides,
my regiment had been mentioned in
the first official communiqu&eacute;. The 1st Regiment
of Uhlans and the 155th Regiment of
Infantry had taken Kalisch. We were therefore
celebrated as heroes and naturally felt
like heroes. Wedel had found a Cossack
sword which he showed to admiring girls.
He made a great impression with it. Of
course we asserted that blood was sticking
to it and we invented hair-raising tales about
this peaceful sword of a police officer. We
were very wild and merry until we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
disembarked from the train at Busendorf,
near Diedenhofen.</p>

<p>A short time before the train arrived we
were held up in a long tunnel. It is uncomfortable
enough to stop in a tunnel in
peace time, but to stop suddenly in war is
still more uncomfortable. Some excited,
high-spirited fellow wanted to play a joke
and fired a shot. Before long there was
general firing in the tunnel. It was surprising
that no one was hurt. It has never
been found out how the general shooting
was brought about.</p>

<p>At Busendorf we had to get out of the
train. The heat was so great that our horses
almost collapsed. On the following day we
marched unceasingly northward in the direction
of Luxemburg. In the meantime, I had
discovered that my brother had ridden in
the same direction with a cavalry division a
week before. I discovered his spoor once
more, but I didn't see him until a year later.</p>

<p>Arrived in Luxemburg no one knew what
were our relations with the people of that
little State. When I saw a Luxemburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'prisoner. He'">prisoner, he</ins> told me that he would complain
about me to the German Emperor if
I did not set him free immediately. I
thought there was reason in what he said.
So I let him go. We passed through the
town of Luxemburg and through Esch and
we approached the first fortified towns of
Belgium.</p>

<p>While advancing our infantry, and indeed,
our whole division, manoeuvred exactly
as in peace time. All were extremely
excited. It was a good thing that we had
to act exactly as we had done at manoeuvres,
otherwise we should certainly have done
some wild things. To the right and to the
left of us, before and behind us, on every
road, marched troops belonging to different
army corps. One had the feeling that
everything was in a great disorder. Suddenly,
this unspeakable cuddle-muddle was
dissolved and became a most wonderfully
arranged evolution.</p>

<p>I was entirely ignorant about the activities
of our flying men, and I got tremendously
excited whenever I saw an aviator.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Of course I had not the slightest idea
whether it was a German airman, or an
enemy. I had at that time not even the
knowledge that the German machines were
marked with crosses and the enemy machines
with circles. The consequence was
that every aeroplane we saw was fired upon.
Our old pilots are still telling of their painful
feelings while being shot at by friend and
enemy with perfect impartiality.</p>

<p>We marched and marched, sending patrols
far ahead, until we arrived at Arlon. I had
an uneasy feeling when crossing, for a second
time, an enemy frontier. Obscure reports
of francs-tireurs, had already come to
my ears.</p>

<p>I had been ordered to work in connection
with my cavalry division, acting as a connecting
link. On that day I had ridden no
less than sixty-six miles<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> with my men. Not
a horse failed us. That was a splendid
achievement. At Arlon I climbed the steeple
in accordance with the tactical principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
which we had been taught in peace time.
Of course, I saw nothing, for the wicked
enemy was still far away.</p>

<p>At that time we were very harmless. For
instance, I had my men outside the town
and had ridden alone on bicycle right
through the town to the church tower and
ascended it. When I came down again I was
surrounded by a crowd of angry young men
who made hostile eyes and who talked
threateningly in undertones. My bicycle
had, of course, been punctured and I had
to go on foot for half an hour. This incident
amused me. I should have been delighted
had it come to a fight. I felt absolutely
sure of myself with a pistol in my
hand.</p>

<p>Later on I heard that several days previously,
the inhabitants had behaved very
seditiously towards our cavalry, and later
on towards our hospitals. It had therefore
been found necessary to place quite a number
of these gentlemen against the wall.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I reached the station to
which I had been ordered, and learned that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
close to Arlon my only cousin Richthofen
had been killed three days before. During
the rest of the day I stayed with the Cavalry
Division. During the night a causeless
alarm took place, and late at night I
reached my own regiment.</p>

<p>That was a beautiful time. We cavalry
men who had already been in touch with the
enemy and had seen something of war,
were envied by the men of the other armies.
For me it was the most beautiful time during
the whole of the war. I would much like
to pass again through the beginning of the
war.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>I Hear the Whistling of the First<br />
Bullets. (21-22nd August, 1914)</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>I &nbsp;HAD been ordered to find out the strength
of the enemy occupying the large forest
near Virton. I started with fifteen Uhlans
and said to myself: "To-day I shall have
the first fight with the enemy." But my
task was not easy. In so big a forest there
may be lots of things hidden which one can
not see.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>I went to the top of a little hill. A few
hundred paces in front of me was a huge
forest extending over many thousands of
acres. It was a beautiful August morning.
The forest seemed so peaceful and still that
I almost forgot all my war-like ideas.</p>

<p>We approached the margin of the forest.
As we could not discover anything suspicious
with our field glasses we had to go
near and find out whether we should be fired
upon. The men in front were swallowed up
by a forest lane. I followed and at my side
was one of my best Uhlans. At the entrance
to the forest was a lonely forester's cottage.
We rode past it.</p>

<p>The soil indicated that a short time previously
considerable numbers of hostile
cavalry must have passed. I stopped my
men, encouraged them by addressing a few
words to them, and felt sure that I could
absolutely rely upon everyone of my
soldiers. Of course no one thought of anything
except of attacking the enemy. It
lies in the instinct of every German to rush
at the enemy wherever he meets him, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
if he meets hostile cavalry. In my
mind's eye I saw myself at the head of my
little troop sabering a hostile squadron, and
was quite intoxicated with joyful expectation.
The eyes of my Uhlans sparkled. Thus
we followed the spoor at a rapid trot. After
a sharp ride of an hour through the most
beautiful mountaindale the wood became
thinner. We approached the exit. I felt
convinced that there we should meet the
enemy. Therefore, caution! To the right
of our narrow path was a steep rocky wall
many yards high. To the left, was a narrow
rivulet and at the further side a meadow,
fifty yards wide, surrounded by barbed wire.
Suddenly, the trace of horses' hooves disappeared
over a bridge into the bushes. My
leading men stopped because the exit from
the forest was blocked by a barricade.</p>

<p>Immediately I recognized that I had fallen
into a trap. I saw a movement among the
bushes behind the meadow at my left and
noticed dismounted hostile cavalry. I estimated
that there were fully one hundred
rifles. In that direction nothing could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
done. My path right ahead was cut by the
barricade. To the right were steep rocks. To
the left the barbed wire surrounded the
meadow and prevented me attacking as I had
intended. Nothing was to be done except to
go back. I knew that my dear Uhlans would
be willing to do everything except to run
away from the enemy. That spoilt our fun,
for a second later we heard the first shot
which was followed by very intensive rifle
fire from the wood. The distance was from
fifty to one hundred yards. I had told my
men that they should join me immediately
when they saw me lifting up my hand. I
felt sure we had to go back. So I lifted my
arm and beckoned my men to follow. Possibly,
they misunderstood my gesture. The
cavalrymen who were following me believed
me in danger, and they came rushing along
at a great speed to help me to get away. As
we were on a narrow forest path one can
imagine the confusion which followed. The
horses of the two men ahead rushed away in
a panic because the noise of every shot was
increased tenfold by the narrowness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
hollow way. The last I saw of them was
as they leaped the barricade. I never heard
anything of them again. They were no
doubt made prisoners. I myself turned my
horse and gave him the spurs, probably for
the first time during his life. I had the
greatest difficulty to make the Uhlans who
rushed towards me understand that they
should not advance any further, that we
were to turn round and get away. My
orderly rode at my side. Suddenly his horse
was hit and fell. I jumped over them and
horses were rolling all around me. In short,
it was a wild disorder. The last I saw of my
servant, he was lying under his horse, apparently
not wounded, but pinned down by
the weight of the animal. The enemy had
beautifully surprised us. He had probably
observed us from the very beginning and
had intended to trap us and to catch us unawares
as is the character of the French.</p>

<p>I was delighted when, two days later, I
saw my servant standing before me. He
wore only one boot for he had left the other
one under the body of his horse. He told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
me how he had escaped. At least two squadrons
of French cuirassiers had issued from
the forest in order to plunder the fallen
horses and the brave Uhlans. Not being
wounded, he had jumped up, climbed the
rocks and had fallen down exhausted among
the bushes. About two hours later, when the
enemy had again hidden himself, he had continued
his flight. So he had joined me after
some days, but he could tell me little about
the fate of his comrades who had been left
behind.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>A Ride With Loen</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>THE battle of Virton was proceeding.
My comrade Loen and I had once more
to ascertain what had become of the enemy.
We rode after the enemy during the whole
of the day, reached him at last and were
able to write a very decent report. In the
evening, the great question was: Shall we
go on riding, throughout the night in order
to join our troops, or shall we economize our
strength and take a rest so that we shall
be fresh the next day? The splendid thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
about cavalrymen on patrol is that they are
given complete liberty of action.</div>

<p>We resolved to pass the night near the
enemy and to ride on the next morning. According
to our strategical notions, the enemy
was retiring and we were following him.
Consequently, we could pass the night with
fair security.</p>

<p>Not far from the enemy there was a wonderful
monastery with large stables. So
both Loen and I had quarters for ourselves
and our men. Of course, in the evening,
when we entered our new domicile, the
enemy was so near that he could have shot
us through the windows.</p>

<p>The monks were extremely amiable. They
gave us as much to eat and to drink as we
cared to have and we had a very good time.
The saddles were taken off the horses and
they were very happy when for the first time
in three days and three nights, a dead weight
of nearly three hundred pounds was taken
from their backs. We settled down as if
we were on manoeuvres and as if we were
in the house of a delightful host and friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
At the same time, it should be observed
that three days later, we hanged several of
our hosts to the lanterns because they could
not overcome their desire to take a hand in
the war. But that evening they were really
extremely amiable. We got into our nightshirts,
jumped into bed, posted a sentinel,
and let the Lord look after us.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night somebody suddenly
flung open the door and shouted:
"Sir, the French are there!" I was too
sleepy and too heavy to be able to reply.
Loen, who was similarly incapacitated, gave
the most intelligent answer: "How many
are they?" The soldier stammered, full of
excitement, "We have shot dead two, but
we cannot say how many there are for it is
pitch dark." I heard Loen reply, in a sleepy
tone: "All right. When more arrive call me
again." Half a minute later both of us were
snoring again.</p>

<p>The sun was already high in the horizon
when we woke up from a refreshing sleep
the next morning. We took an ample breakfast
and then continued our journey.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the French had passed
by our castle during the night and our sentinels
had fired on them. As it was a very
dark night nothing further followed.</p>

<p>Soon we passed through a pretty valley.
We rode over the old battlefield of our
Division and discovered, to our surprise, that
it was peopled not with German soldiers, but
with French Red Cross men. Here and
there were French soldiers. They looked as
surprised at seeing us as we did at seeing
them. Nobody thought of shooting. We
cleared out as rapidly as possible and gradually
it dawned upon us that our troops, instead
of advancing, had retired. Fortunately,
the enemy had retired at the same
time in the opposite direction. Otherwise
I should now be somewhere in captivity.</p>

<p>We passed through the village of Robelmont
where, on the previous day, we had
seen our Infantry in occupation. We encountered
one of the inhabitants and asked
him what had become of our soldiers. He
looked very happy and assured me that the
Germans had departed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Late in the afternoon I reached my regiment
and was quite satisfied with the course
of events during the last twenty-four hours.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>




<h2>III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><i>Boredom Before Verdun</i></div>


<div class='cap'>I &nbsp;AM a restless spirit. Consequently my
activity in front of Verdun can only be
described as boresome. At the beginning I
was in the trenches at a spot where nothing
happened. Then I became a dispatch-bearer
and hoped to have some adventures.
But there I was mistaken. The fighting
men immediately degraded me and considered
me a Base-hog. I was not really at
the Base but I was not allowed to advance
further than within 1500 yards behind the
front trenches. There, below the ground, I
had a bomb-proof, heated habitation. Now
and then I had to go to the front trenches.
That meant great physical exertion, for one
had to trudge uphill and downhill, criss-cross,
through an unending number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
trenches and mire-holes until at last one
arrived at a place where men were firing.
After having paid a short visit to the fighting
men, my position seemed to me a very
stupid one.</div>

<p>At that time the digging business was
beginning. It had not yet become clear to
us what it means to dig approaches and endless
trenches. Of course, we knew the
names of the various ditches and holes
through the lessons which we had received
at the War Academy. However, the digging
was considered to be the business of the
military engineers. Other troops were supposed
not to take a hand in it. Here, near
Combres, everyone was digging industriously.
Every soldier had a spade and a pick
and took all imaginable trouble in order to
get as deeply into the ground as possible.
It was very strange that in many places
the French were only five yards ahead of us.
One could hear them speak and see them
smoke cigarettes and now and then they
threw us a piece of paper. We conversed
with them, but nevertheless, we tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
annoy them in every possible way, especially
with hand grenades.</p>

<p>Five hundreds yards in front of us and five
hundred yards behind the trenches the dense
forest of the C&ocirc;te Lorraine had been cut
down by the vast number of shells and
bullets which were fired unceasingly. It
seemed unbelievable that in front men could
live. Nevertheless, the men in the front
trenches were not in as bad a position as the
men at the Base.</p>

<p>After a morning visit to the front
trenches, which usually took place at the
earliest hours of the day, the more tedious
business began. I had to attend to the telephone.</p>

<p>On days when I was off duty I indulged
in my favorite pastime, game shooting. The
forest of La Chaussee gave me ample opportunities.
When going for a ride I had noticed
that there were wild pigs about and
I tried to find out where I could shoot them
at night. Beautiful nights, with a full moon
and snow, came to my aid. With the assistance
of my servant I built a shelter seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in a tree, at a spot where the pigs
passed, and waited there at night. Thus
I passed many a night sitting on the
branch of a tree and on the next morning
found that I had become an icicle.
However, I got my reward. There was a
sow which was particularly interesting.
Every night she swam across the lake, broke
into a potato field, always at the same spot,
and then she swam back again. Of course
I very much wished to improve my acquaintance
with the animal. So I took a seat
on the other shore of the lake. In accordance
with our previous arrangement, Auntie
Pig appeared at midnight for her supper. I
shot her while she was still swimming and
she would have been drowned had I not
succeeded at the last moment in seizing her
by the leg.</p>

<p>At another time, I was riding with my
servant along a narrow path. Suddenly I
saw several wild pigs crossing it. Immediately
I jumped from the horse, grasped my
servant's carbine and rushed several hundred
yards ahead. At the end of the procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
came a mighty boar. I had never yet seen
such a beast and was surprised at its gigantic
size. Now it ornaments my room and reminds
me of my encounter.</p>

<p>In this manner I passed several months
when, one fine day, our division became busy.
We intended a small attack. I was delighted,
for now at last I should be able to
do something as a connecting link! But
there came another disappointment! I was
given quite a different job and now I had
enough of it. I sent a letter to my Commanding
General and evil tongues report
that I told him: "My dear Excellency! I
have not gone to war in order to collect
cheese and eggs, but for another purpose."
At first, the people above wanted to snarl
at me. But then they fulfilled my wish.
Thus I joined the Flying Service at the end
of May, 1915. My greatest wish was fulfilled.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>




<h2>IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><i>In the Air</i></div>


<div class='cap'>THE next morning at seven o'clock
I was to fly for the first time as an
observer!&mdash;I was naturally very excited, for
I had no idea what it would be like. Everyone
whom I had asked about his feelings
told me a different tale. The night before,
I went to bed earlier than usual in order to
be thoroughly refreshed the next morning.
We drove over to the flying ground, and I got
into a flying machine for the first time. The
draught from the propeller was a beastly
nuisance. I found it quite impossible to make
myself understood by the pilot. Everything
was carried away by the wind. If I took up
a piece of paper it disappeared. My safety
helmet slid off. My muffler dropped off.
My jacket was not sufficiently buttoned. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
short, I felt very uncomfortable. Before I
knew what was happening, the pilot went
ahead at full speed and the machine started
rolling. We went faster and faster. I
clutched the sides of the car. Suddenly, the
shaking was over, the machine was in the
air and the earth dropped away from under
me.</div>

<p>I had been told the name of the place to
which we were to fly. I was to direct my
pilot. At first we flew right ahead, then my
pilot turned to the right, then to the left, but
I had lost all sense of direction above our
own aerodrome. I had not the slightest
notion where I was! I began very cautiously
to look over the side at the country.
The men looked ridiculously small. The
houses seemed to come out of a child's toy
box. Everything seemed pretty. Cologne
was in the background. The cathedral
looked like a little toy. It was a glorious
feeling to be so high above the earth, to be
master of the air. I didn't care a bit where
I was and I felt extremely sad when my
pilot thought it was time to go down again.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>I should have liked best to start immediately
on another flight. I have never had
any trouble in the air such as vertigo. The
celebrated American swings are to me disgusting.
One does not feel secure in them,
but in a flying machine one possesses a
feeling of complete security. One sits in
an aeroplane as in an easy chair. Vertigo is
impossible. No man exists who has been
turned giddy by flying. At the same time,
flying affects one's nerves. When one races
full speed through the air, and particularly
when one goes down again, when the aeroplane
suddenly dips, when the engine stops
running, and when the tremendous noise is
followed by an equally tremendous silence,
then I would frantically clutch the sides and
think that I was sure to fall to the ground.
However, everything happened in such a
matter-of-fact and natural way, and the
landing, when we again touched terra firma
was so simple, that I could not have such a
feeling as fear. I was full of enthusiasm
and should have liked to remain in an aeroplane
all day long. I counted the hours to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the time when we should start out again.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>As an Observer with Mackensen</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>ON the 10th of June, 1915 I came to
Grossenhain. Thence I was to be sent
to the front. I was anxious to go forward
as quickly as possible. I feared that I might
come too late, that the world-war might be
over. I should have had to spend three
months to become a pilot. By the time the
three months had gone by, peace might have
been concluded. Therefore, it never occurred
to me to become a pilot. I imagined that,
owing to my training as a cavalryman, I
might do well as an observer. I was very
happy when, after a fortnight's flying experience,
I was sent out, especially as I was
sent to the only spot where there was still
a chance of a war of movement. I was sent
to Russia.</div>

<p>Mackensen was advancing gloriously. He
had broken through the Russian position at
Gorlice and I joined his army when we were
taking Rawa Ruska. I spent a day at the
aviation base and then I was sent to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
celebrated 69th Squadron. Being quite a beginner
I felt very foolish. My pilot was a
big gun, First Lieutenant Zeumer. He is
now a cripple. Of the other men of the Section,
I am the only survivor.</p>

<p>Now came my most beautiful time. Life
in the Flying Corps is very much like life
in the cavalry. Every day, morning and
afternoon, I had to fly and to reconnoiter,
and I have brought back valuable information
many a time.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>With Holck in Russia. (Summer, 1915)</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>DURING June, July and August, 1915, I
remained with the Flying Squadron
which participated in Mackensen's advance
from Gorlice to Brest-Litovsk. I had joined
it as quite a juvenile observer and had not
the slightest idea of anything.</div>

<p>As a cavalryman my business had consisted
in reconnoitering. So the Aeroplane
Service as an observer was in my line and
it amused me vastly to take part in the
gigantic reconnoitering flights which we undertook
nearly every day.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>For an observer it is important to find a
pilot with a strong character. One fine day
we were told, "Count Holck will join us."
Immediately I thought, "That is the man I
want."</p>

<p>Holck made his appearance, not as one
would imagine, in a 60 h. p. Mercedes
or in a first-class sleeping car. He came on
foot. After traveling by railway for days
and days he had arrived in the vicinity of
Jaroslav. Here he got out of the train for
there was once more an unending stoppage.
He told his servant to travel on with the
luggage while he would go on foot. He
marched along and after an hour's walking
looked back, but the train did not follow
him. So he walked and walked and walked
without being overtaken by the train until,
after a thirty-mile walk, he arrived in Rawa
Ruska, his objective. Twenty-four hours
later his orderly appeared with the luggage.
His thirty-mile walk proved no difficulty to
that sportsman. His body was so well
trained that he did not feel the tramp he had
undertaken.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Count Holck was not only a sportsman on
land. Flying also was to him a sport which
gave him the greatest pleasure. He was
a pilot of rare talent and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'particularly'">particularity</ins>, and
that is, after all, the principal thing. He towered
head and shoulders above the enemy.</p>

<p>We went on many a beautiful reconnoitering
flight&mdash;I do not know how far&mdash;into
Russia. Although Holck was so young I
had never a feeling of insecurity with him.
On the contrary he was always a support to
me in critical moments. When I looked
around and saw his determined face I had
always twice as much courage as I had had
before.</p>

<p>My last flight with him nearly led to
trouble. We had not had definite orders to
fly. The glorious thing in the flying service
is that one feels that one is a perfectly free
man and one's own master as soon as one
is up in the air.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">THE FAMOUS RICHTHOFEN &quot;CIRCUS&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>We had to change our flying base and we
were not quite certain in which meadow we
were to land. In order not to expose our
machine to too much risk in landing we flew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in the direction of Brest-Litovsk. The Russians
were retiring everywhere. The whole
countryside was burning. It was a terribly
beautiful picture. We intended to ascertain
the direction of the enemy columns, and in
doing so flew over the burning town of
Wicznice. A gigantic smoke cloud, which
went up to about 6,000 feet, prevented us
continuing our flight because we flew at an
altitude of only 4,500 feet in order to see
better. For a moment Holck reflected. I
asked him what he intended to do and advised
him to fly around the smoke cloud
which would have involved a round-about
way of five minutes. Holck did not intend to
do this. On the contrary. The greater the
danger was the more the thing attracted him.
Therefore straight through! I enjoyed it,
too, to be together with such a daring fellow.
Our venturesomeness nearly cost us
dear. As soon as the tail-end of the machine
had disappeared in the smoke the aeroplane
began to reel. I could not see a thing for the
smoke made my eyes water. The air was
much warmer and beneath me I saw nothing
but a huge sea of fire. Suddenly the machine
lost its balance and fell, turning round
and round. I managed to grasp a stay and
hung on to it. Otherwise I should have been
thrown out of the machine. The first thing
I did was to look at Holck and immediately
I regained my courage for his face showed
an iron confidence. The only thought which
I had was: "It is stupid, after all, to die so
unnecessarily a hero's death."</p>

<p>Later on, I asked Holck what had been
his thoughts at the moment. He told me he
had never experienced so unpleasant a feeling.</p>

<p>We fell down to an altitude of 1500 feet
above the burning town. Either through the
skill of my pilot or by a Higher Will, perhaps
by both, we suddenly dropped out of
the smoke cloud. Our good Albatros found
itself again and once more flew straight
ahead as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>We had now had enough of it and instead
of going to a new base intended to return
to our old quarter as quickly as possible.
After all, we were still above the Russians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a><br /><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and only at an altitude of 1500 feet. Five
minutes later I heard Holck, behind me, exclaiming:
"The motor is giving out."</p>

<p>I must add that Holck had not as much
knowledge of motors as he had of horseflesh
and I had not the slightest idea of
mechanics. The only thing which I knew
was that we should have to land among the
Russians if the motor went on strike. So
one peril had followed the other.</p>

<p>I convinced myself that the Russians beneath
us were still marching with energy.
I could see them quite clearly from our low
altitude. Besides it was not necessary to
look, for the Russians shot at us with machine-guns
with the utmost diligence. The
firing sounded like chestnuts roasting near
a fire.</p>

<p>Presently the motor stopped running altogether,
for it had been hit. So we went
lower and lower. We just managed to
glide over a forest and landed at last in an
abandoned artillery position which, the evening
before, had still been occupied by Russians,
as I had reported.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>I told Holck my impressions. We jumped
out of our box and tried to rush into the
forest nearby, where we might have defended
ourselves. I had with me a pistol
and six cartridges. Holck had nothing.</p>

<p>When we had reached the wood we
stopped and I saw with my glasses that a
soldier was running towards our aeroplane.
I was horrified to see that he wore not a
spiked helmet but a cap. So I felt sure that
it was a Russian. When the man came
nearer Holck shouted with joy, for he was
a Grenadier of the Prussian Guards.</p>

<p>Our troops had once more stormed the
position at the break of day and had broken
through into the enemy batteries.</p>

<p>On that occasion Holck lost his little favorite,
his doggie. He took the little animal
with him in every flight. The dog would lie
always quietly on Holck's fur in the fusilage.
He was still with us when we were in the
forest. Soon after, when we had talked
with the Guardsman, German troops passed
us. They were the staffs of the Guards and
Prince Eitel Friedrich with his Adjutants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and his Orderly Officers. The Prince supplied
us with horses so that we two cavalrymen
were sitting once more on oat-driven
motors. Unfortunately doggie was lost
while we were riding. Probably he followed
other troops by mistake.</p>

<p>Later in the evening we arrived in our
old flying base on a cart. The machine was
smashed.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>Russia&mdash;Ostend (From the Two-Seater<br />
to the Twin-Engined Fighter)</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>THE German enterprise in Russia came
gradually to a stop and suddenly I was
transferred to a large battle-plane at Ostend
on the twenty-first of August, 1915. There
I met an old acquaintance, friend Zeumer.
Besides I was attracted by the tempting
name "Large Battle-plane."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></div>

<p>I had a very good time during this part
of my service. I saw little of the war but my
experiences were invaluable to me, for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
passed my apprenticeship as a battle-flier.
We flew a great deal, we had rarely a fight
in the air and we had no successes. We had
seized a hotel on the Ostend shore, and
there we bathed every afternoon. Unfortunately
the only frequenters of the watering-place
were soldiers. Wrapped up in our
many-colored bathing gowns we sat on the
terraces of Ostend and drank our coffee in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>One fine day we were sitting as usual on
the shore drinking coffee. Suddenly we
heard bugles. We were told that an English
squadron was approaching. Of course we
did not allow ourselves to be alarmed and
to be disturbed, but continued drinking our
coffee. Suddenly somebody called out:
"There they are!" Indeed we could see on
the horizon, though not very distinctly, some
smoking chimneys and later on could make
out ships. Immediately we fetched our telescopes
and observed them. There was indeed
quite an imposing number of vessels.
It was not quite clear to us what they intended
to do, but soon we were to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
better. We went up to the roof whence we
could see more. Suddenly we heard a whistling
in the air; then there came a big bang
and a shell hit that part of the beach where
a little before we had been bathing. I have
never rushed as rapidly into the hero's
cellar as I did at that moment. The English
squadron shot perhaps three or four times
at us and then it began bombarding the
harbor and railway station. Of course they
hit nothing but they gave a terrible fright
to the Belgians. One shell fell right in the
beautiful Palace Hotel on the shore. That
was the only damage that was done. Happily
they destroyed only English capital, for
it belonged to Englishmen.</p>

<p>In the evening we flew again with energy.
On one of our flights we had gone very far
across the sea with our battle-plane. It had
two motors and we were experimenting with
a new steering gear which, we were told,
would enable us to fly in a straight line with
only a single motor working.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> When we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
were fairly far out I saw beneath us, not
on the water but below the surface, a ship.
It is a funny thing. If the sea is quiet, one
can look down from above to the bottom of
the sea. Of course it is not possible where
the sea is twenty-five miles deep but one can
see clearly through several hundred yards of
water. I had not made a mistake in believing
that the ship was traveling not on the
surface but below the surface. Yet it seemed
at first that it was traveling above water.
I drew Zeumer's attention to my discovery
and we went lower in order to see more
clearly. I am too little of a naval expert to
say what it was but it was clear to me that
it was bound to be a submarine. But of
what nationality? That is a difficult question
which in my opinion can be solved only
by a naval expert, and not always by him.
One can scarcely distinguish colors under
water and there is no flag. Besides a
submarine does not carry such things. We
had with us a couple of bombs and I debated
with myself whether I should throw them
or not. The submarine had not seen us for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
it was partly submerged. We might have
flown above it without danger and we might
have waited until they found it necessary to
come to the surface for air. Then we could
have dropped our eggs. Herein lies, no
doubt, a very critical point for our sister
arm.</p>

<p>When we had fooled around the apparition
beneath us for quite a while I suddenly
noticed that the water was gradually
disappearing from our cooling apparatus.
I did not like that and I drew my
colleague's attention to the fact. He pulled
a long face and hastened to get home.
However, we were approximately twelve
miles from the shore and they had to be
flown over. The motor began running more
slowly and I was quietly preparing myself
for a sudden cold immersion. But lo!
and behold! we got through! Our giant
apple-barge<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> barged along with a single
motor and the new steering apparatus and
we reached the shore and managed to land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
in the harbor without any special difficulty.</p>

<p>It is a good thing to be lucky. Had we
not tried the new steering apparatus on that
day there would not have been any hope
for us. We should certainly have been
drowned.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>A Drop of Blood for the Fatherland</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>I&nbsp; HAVE never been really wounded. At
the critical moment I have probably
bent my head or pulled in my chest. Often
I have been surprised that they did not hit
me. Once a bullet went through both my
furlined boots. Another time a bullet went
through my muffler. Another time one
went along my arm through the fur and
the leather jacket; but I have never been
touched.</div>

<p>One fine day we started with our large
battle-plane in order to delight the English
with our bombs. We reached our object.
The first bomb fell. It is very interesting
to ascertain the effect of a bomb. At least
one always likes to see it exploding. Unfortunately
my large battle-plane, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
well qualified for carrying bombs, had a
stupid peculiarity which prevented me from
seeing the effect of a bomb-throw, for immediately
after the throw the machine came
between my eye and the object and covered
it completely with its planes. This always
made me wild because one does not like to
be deprived of one's amusement. If you
hear a bang down below and see the delightful
grayish-whitish cloud of the explosion
in the neighborhood of the object aimed at,
you are always very pleased. Therefore I
waved to friend Zeumer that he should bend
a little to the side. While waving to him
I forgot that the infamous object on which I
was traveling, my apple-barge, had two propellers
which turned to the right and left
of my observer-seat.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I meant to show him
where approximately the bomb had hit and
bang! my finger was caught! I was somewhat
surprised when I discovered that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
little finger had been damaged. Zeumer did
not notice anything.</p>

<p>Having been hit on the hand I did not care
to throw any more bombs. I quickly got rid
of the lot and we hurried home. My love
for the large battle-plane, which after all
had not been very great, suffered seriously
in consequence of my experience. I had to
sit quiet for seven days and was debarred
from flying. Only my beauty was slightly
damaged, but after all, I can say with pride
that I also have been wounded in the war.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>My First Fight in the<br />
Air. (1st Sept., 1915)</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>ZEUMER and I were very anxious to
have a fight in the air. Of course we
flew our large battle-plane. The title of
our barge alone gave us so much courage
that we thought it impossible for any opponent
to escape us.</div>

<p>We flew every day from five to six hours
without ever seeing an Englishman. I became
quite discouraged, but one fine morning
we again went out to hunt. Suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
I discovered a Farman aeroplane which was
reconnoitering without taking notice of us.
My heart beat furiously when Zeumer flew
towards it. I was curious to see what was
going to happen. I had never witnessed a
fight in the air and had about as vague an
idea of it as it was possible to have.</p>

<p>Before I knew what was happening both
the Englishman and I rushed by one another.
I had fired four shots at most while the
Englishman was suddenly in our rear firing
into us like anything. I must say I never
had any sense of danger because I had no
idea how the final result of such a fight
would come about. We turned and turned
around one another until at last, to our
great surprise the Englishman turned away
from us and flew off. I was greatly disappointed
and so was my pilot.</p>

<p>Both of us were in very bad spirits when
we reached home. He reproached me for
having shot badly and I reproached him for
not having enabled me to shoot well. In
short our aeroplanic relations, which previously
had been faultless, suffered severely.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>We looked at our machine and discovered
that it had received quite a respectable number
of hits.</p>

<p>On the same day we went on the chase
for a second time but again we had no success.
I felt very sad. I had imagined that
things would be very different in a battle
squadron. I had always believed that one
shot would cause the enemy to fall, but soon
I became convinced that a flying machine
can stand a great deal of punishment. Finally
I felt assured that I should never bring
down a hostile aeroplane, however much
shooting I did.</p>

<p>We did not lack courage. Zeumer was a
wonderful flier and I was quite a good shot.
We stood before a riddle. We were not the
only ones to be puzzled. Many are nowadays
in the same position in which we were then.
After all the flying business must really be
thoroughly understood.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>In the Champagne Battle</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>OUR pleasant days at Ostend were soon
past, for the Champagne battle began
and we flew to the front in order to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
part in it in our large battle-plane. Soon
we discovered that our packing-case<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> was a
capacious aeroplane but that it could never
be turned into a good battle-plane.</div>

<p>I flew once with Osteroth who had a
smaller flier than the apple-barge. About
three miles behind the front we encountered
a Farman Two-seater. He allowed us to
approach him and for the first time in my
life I saw an aerial opponent from quite
close by. Osteroth flew with great skill
side by side with the enemy so that I could
easily fire at him. Our opponent probably
did not notice us, for only when I had
trouble with my gun did he begin to shoot
at us. When I had exhausted my supply
of one hundred bullets I thought I could
not trust my eyes when I suddenly
noticed that my opponent was going
down in curious spirals. I followed him
with my eyes and tapped Osteroth's
head to draw his attention. Our opponent
fell and fell and dropped at last into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
a large crater. There he was, his machine
standing on its head, the tail pointing towards
the sky. According to the map he
had fallen three miles behind the front. We
had therefore brought him down on enemy
ground.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Otherwise I should have one more
victory to my credit. I was very proud of
my success. After all, the chief thing is
to bring a fellow down. It does not matter
at all whether one is credited for it or not.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>How I Met Boelcke</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>FRIEND Zeumer got a Fokker Monoplane.
Therefore I had to sail through
the world alone. The Champagne battle
was raging. The French flying men were
coming to the fore. We were to be combined
in a battle squadron and took train
on the first of October, 1915.</div>

<p>In the dining car, at the table next to me,
was sitting a young and insignificant-looking
lieutenant. There was no reason to take
any note of him except for the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
he was the only man who had succeeded in
shooting down a hostile flying man not once
but four times. His name had been mentioned
in the dispatches. I thought a great
deal of him because of his experience. Although
I had taken the greatest trouble, I
had not brought an enemy down up to that
time. At least I had not been credited with
a success.</p>

<p>I would have liked so much to find out
how Lieutenant Boelcke managed his business.
So I asked him: "Tell me, how do you
manage it?" He seemed very amused and
laughed, although I had asked him quite
seriously. Then he replied: "Well it is quite
simple. I fly close to my man, aim well and
then of course he falls down." I shook my
head and told him that I did the same thing
but my opponents unfortunately did not
come down. The difference between him
and me was that he flew a Fokker and I a
large battle-plane.</p>

<p>I took great trouble to get more closely
acquainted with that nice modest fellow
whom I badly wanted to teach me his business.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
We often played cards together, went
for walks and I asked him questions. At
last I formed a resolution that I also would
learn to fly a Fokker. Perhaps then my
chances would improve.</p>

<p>My whole aim and ambition became now
concentrated upon learning how to manipulate
the sticks myself. Hitherto I had been
nothing but an observer. Happily I soon
found an opportunity to learn piloting on an
old machine in the Champagne. I threw
myself into the work with body and soul and
after twenty-five training flights I stood
before the examination in flying alone.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>




<h2>V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><i>My First Solo-Flight. (10th October, 1915)</i></div>


<div class='cap'>THERE are some moments in one's life
which tickle one's nerves particularly
and the first solo-flight is among them.</div>

<p>One fine evening my teacher, Zeumer, told
me: "Now go and fly by yourself." I must
say I felt like replying "I am afraid." But
this is a word which should never be used
by a man who defends his country. Therefore,
whether I liked it or not, I had to make
the best of it and get into my machine.</p>

<p>Zeumer explained to me once more every
movement in theory. I scarcely listened to
his explanations for I was firmly convinced
that I should forget half of what he was
telling me.</p>

<p>I started the machine. The aeroplane
went at the prescribed speed and I could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
help noticing that I was actually flying.
After all I did not feel timorous but rather
elated. I did not care for anything. I
should not have been frightened no matter
what happened. With contempt of death I
made a large curve to the left, stopped the
machine near a tree, exactly where I had
been ordered to, and looked forward to see
what would happen. Now came the most
difficult thing, the landing. I remembered
exactly what movements I had to make. I
acted mechanically and the machine moved
quite differently from what I had expected.
I lost my balance, made some wrong movements,
stood on my head and I succeeded in
converting my aeroplane into a battered
school 'bus. I was very sad, looked at the
damage which I had done to the machine,
which after all was not very great, and had
to suffer from other people's jokes.</p>

<p>Two days later I went with passion at
the flying and suddenly I could handle the
apparatus.</p>

<p>A fortnight later I had to take my first
examination. Herr von T&mdash;&mdash; was my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
examiner. I described the figure eight several
times, exactly as I had been told to do,
landed several times with success, in accordance
with orders received and felt very proud
of my achievements. However, to my great
surprise I was told that I had not passed.
There was nothing to be done but to try
once more to pass the initial examination.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>My Training Time at D&ouml;beritz</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>IN order to pass my examinations I had
to go to Berlin. I made use of the opportunity
to go to Berlin as observer in a giant
plane.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> I was ordered to go by aeroplane to
D&ouml;beritz near Berlin on the fifteenth of November,
1915. In the beginning I took a
great interest in the giant-plane. But
funnily enough the gigantic machine made
it clear to me that only the smallest aeroplane
would be of any use for me in battle.
A big aerial barge is too clumsy for fighting.
Agility is needed and, after all, fighting is
my business.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>The difference between a large battle-plane
and a giant-plane is that a giant-plane
is considerably larger than a large battle-plane
and that it is more suitable for use as
a bomb-carrier than as a fighter.</p>

<p>I went through my examinations in D&ouml;beritz
together with a dear fellow, First
Lieutenant von Lyncker. We got on very
well with one another, had the same inclinations
and the same ideas as to our future
activity. Our aim was to fly Fokkers and
to be included in a battle squadron on the
Western front. A year later we succeeded
in working together for a short time. A
deadly bullet hit my dear friend when bringing
down his third aeroplane.</p>

<p>We passed many merry hours in D&ouml;beritz.
One of the things which we had to do was
to land in strange quarters. I used the opportunity
to combine the necessary with the
agreeable. My favorable landing place outside
of our aerodrome was the Buchow
Estate where I was well known. I was
there invited to shoot wild pigs. The matter
could be combined only with difficulty with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the service, for on fine evenings I wished
both to fly and to shoot pigs. So I arranged
for a place of landing in the neighborhood of
Buchow whence I could easily reach my
friends.</p>

<p>I took with me a second pilot, who served
as an observer, and sent him back in the
evening. During the night I shot pigs and
on the next morning was fetched by my
pilot.</p>

<p>If I had not been fetched with the aeroplane
I should have been in a hole for I
should have had to march on foot a distance
of about six miles. So I required a
man who would fetch me in any weather. It
is not easy to find a man who will fetch you
under any circumstances.</p>

<p>Once, when I had passed the night trying
to shoot pigs, a tremendous snowfall set in.
One could not see fifty yards ahead. My
pilot was to fetch me at eight sharp. I
hoped that for once he would not come. But
suddenly I heard a humming noise&mdash;one
could not see a thing&mdash;and five minutes later
my beloved bird was squatting before me on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the ground. Unfortunately some of his
bones had got bent.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>I Become a Pilot</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>ON Christmas Day, 1915, I passed my
third examination. In connection with
it I flew to Schwerin, where the Fokker
works are situated, and had a look at them.
As observer I took with me my mechanic,
and from Schwerin I flew with him to Breslau,
from Breslau to Schweidnitz, from
thence to Luben and then returned to Berlin.
During my tour I landed in lots of different
places in between, visiting relatives and
friends. Being a trained observer, I did not
find it difficult to find my way.</div>

<p>In March, 1916, I joined the Second Battle
Squadron before Verdun and learned air-fighting
as a pilot. I learned how to handle
a fighting aeroplane. I flew then a two-seater.</p>

<p>In the official communiqu&eacute; of the twenty-sixth
of April, 1916, I am referred to for the
first time, although my name is not mentioned.
Only my deeds appear in it. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
had built into my machine a machine gun,
which I had arranged very much in the way
in which it is done in the Nieuport machines.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
I was very proud of my idea.
People laughed at the way I had fitted it up
because the whole thing looked very primitive.
Of course I swore by my new arrangement
and very soon I had an opportunity of
ascertaining its practical value.</p>

<p>I encountered a hostile Nieuport machine
which was apparently guided by a man who
also was a beginner, for he acted extremely
foolishly. When I flew towards him he ran
away. Apparently he had trouble with his
gun. I had no idea of fighting him but
thought: "What will happen if I now start
shooting?" I flew after him, approached
him as closely as possible and then began
firing a short series of well-aimed shots with
my machine gun. The Nieuport reared up
in the air and turned over and over.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<p>At first both my observer and I believed
that this was one of the numerous tricks
which French fliers habitually indulge in.
However, his tricks did not cease. Turning
over and over, the machine went lower and
lower. At last my observer patted me on
the head and called out to me: "I congratulate
you. He is falling." As a matter of
fact he fell into a forest behind Fort Douaumont
and disappeared among the trees. It
became clear to me that I had shot him
down, but on the other side of the Front.
I flew home and reported merely: "I had an
aerial fight and have shot down a Nieuport."
The next day I read of my action in the official
communiqu&eacute;. Of course I was very
proud of my success, but that Nieuport does

<p>
<i>Holck's Death. (30th of April, 1916)</i><br />
</p>

<p>AS a young pilot I once flew over Fort
Douaumont at a moment when it was
exposed to a violent drum-fire. I noticed
that a German Fokker was attacking three
Caudron machines. It was my misfortune
that a strong west wind was blowing. That
was not favorable to me. The Fokker was
driven over the town of Verdun in the course
of the fight. I drew the attention of my
observer to the struggle. He thought that
the German fighting man must be a very
smart fellow. We wondered whether it
could be Boelcke and intended to inquire
when we came down. Suddenly, I saw to
my horror that the German machine, which
previously had attacked, had fallen back
upon the defensive. The strength of the
French fighting men had been increased to
at least ten and their combined assaults
forced the German machine to go lower and
lower.</p>

<p>I could not fly to the German's aid. I was
too far away from the battle. Besides, my
heavy machine could not overcome the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
strong wind against me. The Fokker fought
with despair. His opponents had rushed him
down to an altitude of only about eighteen
hundred feet. Suddenly, he was once more
attacked by his opponents and he disappeared,
plunging into a small cloud. I
breathed more easily, for in my opinion the
cloud had saved him.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the aerodrome, I reported
what I had seen and was told that
the Fokker man was Count Holck, my old
comrade in the Eastern Theater of war.</p>

<p>Count Holck had dropped straight down,
shot through the head. His death deeply
affected me for he was my model. I tried to
imitate his energy and he was a man among
men also as a character.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>




<h2>VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><i>I Fly In a Thunderstorm</i></div>


<div class='cap'>OUR activity before Verdun was disturbed
in the summer of 1916 by frequent
thunderstorms. Nothing is more disagreeable
for flying men than to have to go
through a thunderstorm. In the Battle of
the Somme a whole English flying squadron
came down behind our lines and became
prisoners of war because they had been surprised
by a thunderstorm.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></div>

<p>I had never yet made an attempt to get
through thunder clouds but I could not suppress
my desire to make the experiment.
During the whole day thunder was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
air. From my base at Mont I had flown over
to the fortress of Metz, nearby, in order to
look after various things. During my return
journey I had an adventure.</p>

<p>I was at the aerodrome of Metz and intended
to return to my own quarters. When
I pulled my machine out of the hangar the
first signs of an approaching thunderstorm
became noticeable. Clouds which looked
like a gigantic pitch-black wall approached
from the north. Old experienced pilots
urged me not to fly. However, I had promised
to return and I should have considered
myself a coward if I had failed to come back
because of a silly thunderstorm. Therefore
I meant to try.</p>

<p>When I started the rain began falling. I
had to throw away my goggles, otherwise
I should not have seen anything. The
trouble was that I had to travel over the
mountains of the Moselle where the thunderstorm
was just raging. I said to myself
that probably I should be lucky and get
through and rapidly approached the black
cloud which reached down to the earth. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
flew at the lowest possible altitude. I was
compelled absolutely to leap over houses and
trees with my machine. Very soon I knew
no longer where I was. The gale seized my
machine as if it were a piece of paper and
drove it along. My heart sank within me.
I could not land among the hills. I was compelled
to go on.</p>

<p>I was surrounded by an inky blackness.
Beneath me the trees bent down in the gale.
Suddenly I saw right in front of me a
wooded height. I could not avoid it. My
Albatros managed to take it. I was able
to fly only in a straight line. Therefore I
had to take every obstacle that I encountered.
My flight became a jumping competition
purely and simply. I had to jump over
trees, villages, spires and steeples, for I had
to keep within a few yards of the ground,
otherwise I should have seen nothing at all.
The lightning was playing around me. At
that time I did not yet know that lightning
cannot touch flying machines. I felt certain
of my death for it seemed to me inevitable
that the gale would throw me at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
moment into a village or a forest. Had the
motor stopped working I should have been
done for.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw that on the horizon the
darkness had become less thick. Over there
the thunderstorm had passed. I would be
saved if I were able to get so far. Concentrating
all my energy I steered towards the
light.</p>

<p>Suddenly I got out of the thunder-cloud.
The rain was still falling in torrents. Still,
I felt saved.</p>

<p>In pouring rain I landed at my aerodrome.
Everyone was waiting for me, for
Metz had reported my start and had told
them that I had been swallowed up by a
thunder cloud.</p>

<p>I shall never again fly through a thunderstorm
unless the Fatherland should demand
this.</p>

<p>Now, when I look back, I realize that it
was all very beautiful. Notwithstanding
the danger during my flight, I experienced
glorious moments which I would not care to
have missed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>


<div class='section'>
<i>My First Time In a Fokker</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>FROM the beginning of my career as a
pilot I had only a single ambition, the ambition
to fly in a single-seater battle-plane.
After worrying my commander for a long
time I at last obtained permission to mount
a Fokker. The revolving motor was a novelty
to me. Besides, it was a strange feeling
to be quite alone during the flight.</div>

<p>The Fokker belonged jointly to a friend of
mine who has died long ago and to myself.
I flew in the morning and he in the afternoon.
Both he and I were afraid that the
other fellow would smash the box. On the
second day we flew towards the enemy.
When I flew in the morning no Frenchman
was to be seen. In the afternoon it was his
turn. He started but did not return. There
was no news from him.</p>

<p>Late in the evening the infantry reported
an aerial battle between a Nieuport and a
German Fokker, in the course of which the
German machine had apparently landed at
the Mort Homme. Evidently the occupant
was friend Reimann for all the other flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
men had returned. We regretted the fate
of our brave comrade. Suddenly, in the
middle of the night, we heard over the telephone
that a German flying officer had made
an unexpected appearance in the front
trenches at the Mort Homme. It appeared
that this was Reimann. His motor had been
smashed by a shot. He had been forced
to land. As he was not able to reach our
own lines he had come to the ground in
No Man's Land. He had rapidly set fire to
the machine and had then quickly hidden
himself in a mine crater. During the night
he had slunk into our trenches. Thus ended
our joint enterprise with a Fokker.</p>

<p>A few days later I was given another
Fokker. This time I felt under a moral obligation
to attend to its destruction myself. I
was flying for the third time. When starting,
the motor suddenly stopped working. I
had to land right away in a field and in a
moment the beautiful machine was converted
into a mass of scrap metal. It was
a miracle that I was not hurt.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>




<h2>VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><i>Bombing In Russia</i></div>


<div class='cap'>IN June we were suddenly ordered to
entrain. No one knew where we were
going, but we had an idea and we were not
over much surprised when our Commander
told us that we were going to Russia. We
had traveled through the whole of Germany
with our perambulating hotel which consisted
of dining and sleeping cars, and
arrived at last at Kovel. There we remained
in our railway cars. There are many advantages
in dwelling in a train. One is always
ready to travel on and need not change one's
quarters.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></div>

<p>In the heat of the Russian summer a sleeping
car is the most horrible instrument of
martyrdom imaginable. Therefore, I agreed
with some friends of mine, Gerstenberg and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Scheele, to take quarters in the forest near
by. We erected a tent and lived like gypsies.
We had a lovely time.</p>

<p>In Russia our battle squadron did a great
deal of bomb throwing. Our occupation
consisted of annoying the Russians. We
dropped our eggs on their finest railway establishments.
One day our whole squadron
went out to bomb a very important railway
station. The place was called Manjewicze
and was situated about twenty miles behind
the Front. That was not very far. The Russians
had planned an attack and the station
was absolutely crammed with colossal
trains. Trains stood close to one another.
Miles of rails were covered with them. One
could easily see that from above. There
was an object for bombing that was worth
while.</p>

<p>One can become enthusiastic over anything.
For a time I was delighted with bomb
throwing. It gave me a tremendous pleasure
to bomb those fellows from above. Frequently
I took part in two expeditions on a
single day.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>On the day mentioned our object was
Manjewicze. Everything was ready. The
aeroplanes were ready to start. Every pilot
tried his motor, for it is a painful thing to
be forced to land against one's will on the
wrong side of the Front line, especially in
Russia. The Russians hated the flyers. If
they caught a flying man they would certainly
kill him. That is the only risk one
ran in Russia for the Russians had no aviators,
or practically none. If a Russian flying
man turned up he was sure to have bad luck
and would be shot down. The anti-aircraft
guns used by Russia were sometimes quite
good, but they were too few in number.
Compared with flying in the West, flying in
the East is absolutely a holiday.</p>

<p>The aeroplanes rolled heavily to the starting
point. They carried bombs to the very
limit of their capacity. Sometimes I dragged
three hundred pounds of bombs with a normal
C-machine.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Besides, I had with me a
very heavy observer who apparently had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
not suffered in any way from the food scarcity.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
I had also with me a couple of machine
guns. I was never able to make proper use
of them in Russia. It is a pity that my collection
of trophies contains not a single
Russian.</p>

<p>Flying with a heavy machine which is
carrying a great dead weight is no fun, especially
during the mid-day summer heat in
Russia. The barges sway in a very disagreeable
manner. Of course, heavily laden
though they are, they do not fall down. The
150 h. p. motors prevent it.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> At the same
time it is no pleasant sensation to carry such
a large quantity of explosives and benzine.</p>

<p>At last we get into a quiet atmosphere.
Now comes the enjoyment of bombing. It is
splendid to be able to fly in a straight line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and to have a definite object and definite
orders. After having thrown one's bombs
one has the feeling that he has achieved
something, while frequently, after searching
for an enemy to give battle to, one comes
home with a sense of failure at not having
brought a hostile machine to the ground.
Then a man is apt to say to himself, "You
have acted stupidly."</p>

<p>It gave me a good deal of pleasure to
throw bombs. After a while my observer
learned how to fly perpendicularly over the
objects to be bombed and to make use of the
right moment for laying his egg with the
assistance of his aiming telescope.</p>

<p>The run to Manjewicze is very pleasant
and I have made it repeatedly. We passed
over gigantic forests which were probably
inhabited by elks and lynxes. But the villages
looked miserable. The only substantial
village in the whole neighborhood was
Manjewicze. It was surrounded by innumerable
tents, and countless barracks had
been run up near the railway station. We
could not make out the Red Cross.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Another flying squadron had visited the
place before us. That could be told by the
smoking houses and barracks. They had not
done badly. The exit of the station had obviously
been blocked by a lucky hit. The
engine was still steaming. The engine driver
had probably dived into a shelter. On the
other side of the station an engine was just
coming out. Of course I felt tempted to
hit it. We flew towards the engine and
dropped a bomb a few hundred yards
in front of it. We had the desired result.
The engine stopped. We turned and continued
throwing bomb after bomb on the
station, carefully taking aim through our
aiming telescope. We had plenty of time
for nobody interfered with us. It is true
that an enemy aerodrome was in the neighborhood
but there was no trace of hostile
pilots. A few anti-aircraft guns were busy,
but they shot not in our direction but in another
one. We reserved a bomb hoping to
make particularly good use of it on our way
home.</p>

<p>Suddenly we noticed an enemy flying machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
starting from its hangar. The question
was whether it would attack us. I did
not believe in an attack. It was more likely
that the flying man was seeking security in
the air, for when bombing machines are
about, the air is the safest place.</p>

<p>We went home by roundabout ways and
looked for camps. It was particularly amusing
to pepper the gentlemen down below
with machine guns. Half savage tribes from
Asia are even more startled when fired at
from above than are cultured Englishmen.
It is particularly interesting to shoot at hostile
cavalry. An aerial attack upsets them
completely. Suddenly the lot of them rush
away in all directions of the compass. I
should not like to be the Commander of a
Squadron of Cossacks which has been fired
at with machine guns from aeroplanes.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>
<p>By and by we could recognize the German
lines. We had to dispose of our last bomb
and we resolved to make a present of it to
a Russian observation balloon, to the only
observation balloon they possessed. We
could quite comfortably descend to within
a few hundred yards of the ground in order
to attack it. At first the Russians began to
haul it in very rapidly. When the bomb had
been dropped the hauling stopped. I did not
believe that I had hit it. I rather imagined
that the Russians had left their chief in the
air and had run away. At last we reached
our front and our trenches and were surprised
to find when we got home that we had
been shot at from below. At least one of the
planes had a hole in it.</p>

<p>Another time and in the same neighborhood
we were ordered to meet an attack of
the Russians who intended to cross the river
Stokhod. We came to the danger spot laden
with bombs and carrying a large number of
cartridges for our machine guns. On arrival
at the Stokhod, we were surprised to see
that hostile cavalry was already crossing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
They were passing over a single bridge. Immediately
it was clear to us that one might
do a tremendous lot of harm to the enemy
by hitting the bridge.</p>

<p>Dense masses of men were crossing. We
went as low as possible and could clearly see
the hostile cavalry crossing by way of the
bridge with great rapidity. The first
bomb fell near the bridge. The second
and third followed immediately. They
created a tremendous disorder. The bridge
had not been hit. Nevertheless traffic
across it had completely ceased. Men
and animals were rushing away in all
directions. We had thrown only three
bombs but the success had been excellent.
Besides, a whole squadron of aeroplanes
was following us. Lastly, we could
do other things. My observer fired energetically
into the crowd down below with
his machine gun and we enjoyed it tremendously.
Of course, I cannot say what real
success we had. The Russians have not
told us. Still I imagined that I alone had
caused the Russian attack to fail. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the official account of the Russian War
Office will give me details after the war.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>At Last!</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>THE August sun was almost unbearably
hot on the sandy flying ground at Kovel.
While we were chatting among ourselves
one of my comrades said: "To-day the great
Boelcke arrives on a visit to us, or rather
to his brother!" In the evening the great
man came to hand. He was vastly admired
by all and he told us many interesting things
about his journey to Turkey. He was just
returning from Turkey and was on the way
to Headquarters. He imagined that he
would go to the Somme to continue his
work. He was to organize a fighting squadron.
He was empowered to select from the
flying corps those men who seemed to him
particularly qualified for his purpose.</div>

<p>I did not dare to ask him to be taken on.
I did not feel bored by the fighting in Russia.
On the contrary, we made extensive and interesting
flights. We bombed the Russians
at their stations. Still, the idea of fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
again on the Western Front attracted me.
There is nothing finer for a young cavalry
officer than the chase of the air.</p>

<p>The next morning Boelcke was to leave
us. Quite early somebody knocked at my
door and before me stood the great man with
the <i>Ordre pour le M&eacute;rite</i>. I knew him, as I
have previously mentioned, but still I had
never imagined that he came to look me up
in order to ask me to become his pupil. I
almost fell upon his neck when he inquired
whether I cared to go with him to the
Somme.</p>

<p>Three days later I sat in the railway
train and traveled through the whole of
Germany straight away to the new field of
my activity. At last my greatest wish was
fulfilled. From now onwards began the
finest time of my life.</p>

<p>At that time I did not dare to hope that
I should be as successful as I have been.
When I left my quarters in the East a good
friend of mine called out after me: "See
that you do not come back without the <i>Ordre
pour le M&eacute;rite</i>."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>




<h2>VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><i>My First English Victim.
(17th September, 1915)</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></div>


<div class='cap'>WE were all at the Butts trying our machine
guns. On the previous day we
had received our new aeroplanes and the
next morning Boelcke was to fly with us.
We were all beginners. None of us had had
a success so far. Consequently everything
that Boelcke told us was to us gospel truth.
Every day, during the last few days, he had,
as he said, shot one or two Englishmen for
breakfast.</div>

<p>The next morning, the seventeenth of
September, was a gloriously fine day. It
was therefore only to be expected that the
English would be very active. Before we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
started Boelcke repeated to us his instructions
and for the first time we flew as a
squadron commanded by the great man
whom we followed blindly.</p>

<p>We had just arrived at the Front when
we recognized a hostile flying squadron
that was proceeding in the direction of Cambrai.
Boelcke was of course the first to see
it, for he saw a great deal more than ordinary
mortals. Soon we understood the position
and everyone of us strove to follow
Boelcke closely. It was clear to all of us
that we should pass our first examination
under the eyes of our beloved leader.</p>

<p>Slowly we approached the hostile squadron.
It could not escape us. We had intercepted
it, for we were between the Front
and our opponents. If they wished to go
back they had to pass us. We counted the
hostile machines. They were seven in number.
We were only five. All the Englishmen
flew large bomb-carrying two-seaters.
In a few seconds the dance would begin.</p>

<p>Boelcke had come very near the first English
machine but he did not yet shoot. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
followed. Close to me were my comrades.
The Englishman nearest to me was traveling
in a large boat painted with dark colors.
I did not reflect very long but took my aim
and shot. He also fired and so did I, and
both of us missed our aim. A struggle began
and the great point for me was to get to
the rear of the fellow because I could only
shoot forward with my gun. He was differently
placed for his machine gun was movable.
It could fire in all directions.</p>

<p>Apparently he was no beginner, for he
knew exactly that his last hour had arrived
at the moment when I got at the back of
him. At that time I had not yet the conviction
"He must fall!" which I have now
on such occasions, but on the contrary, I was
curious to see whether he would fall. There
is a great difference between the two feelings.
When one has shot down one's first,
second or third opponent, then one begins to
find out how the trick is done.</p>

<p>My Englishman twisted and turned, going
criss-cross. I did not think for a moment
that the hostile squadron contained other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Englishmen who conceivably might come to
the aid of their comrade. I was animated by
a single thought: "The man in front of me
must come down, whatever happens." At
last a favorable moment arrived. My opponent
had apparently lost sight of me. Instead
of twisting and turning he flew
straight along. In a fraction of a second I
was at his back with my excellent machine.
I give a short series of shots with my machine
gun. I had gone so close that I was
afraid I might dash into the Englishman.
Suddenly, I nearly yelled with joy for the
propeller of the enemy machine had stopped
turning. I had shot his engine to pieces; the
enemy was compelled to land, for it was impossible
for him to reach his own lines. The
English machine was curiously swinging to
and fro. Probably something had happened
to the pilot. The observer was no longer
visible. His machine gun was apparently
deserted. Obviously I had hit the observer
and he had fallen from his seat.</p>

<p>The Englishman landed close to the flying
ground of one of our squadrons. I was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
excited that I landed also and my eagerness
was so great that I nearly smashed up my
machine. The English flying machine and
my own stood close together. I rushed to
the English machine and saw that a lot of
soldiers were running towards my enemy.
When I arrived I discovered that my assumption
had been correct. I had shot the
engine to pieces and both the pilot and observer
were severely wounded. The observer
died at once and the pilot while being
transported to the nearest dressing station.
I honored the fallen enemy by placing a
stone on his beautiful grave.</p>

<p>When I came home Boelcke and my other
comrades were already at breakfast. They
were surprised that I had not turned up.
I reported proudly that I had shot down an
Englishman. All were full of joy for I was
not the only victor. As usual, Boelcke had
shot down an opponent for breakfast and
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'everyone'">every one</ins> of the other men also had downed
an enemy for the first time.</p>

<p>I would mention that since that time no
English squadron ventured as far as Cambrai<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
as long as Boelcke's squadron was
there.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>


<div class='section'>
<i>The Battle of the Somme</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>DURING my whole life I have not found
a happier hunting ground than in the
course of the Somme Battle. In the morning,
as soon as I had got up, the first Englishmen
arrived, and the last did not disappear
until long after sunset. Boelcke once
said that this was the El Dorado of the flying
men.</div>

<p>There was a time when, within two
months, Boelcke's bag of machines increased
from twenty to forty. We beginners had
not at that time the experience of our
master and we were quite satisfied when we
did not get a hiding. It was an exciting
period. Every time we went up we had a
fight. Frequently we fought really big
battles in the air. There were sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
from forty to sixty English machines, but
unfortunately the Germans were often in
the minority. With them quality was more
important than quantity.</p>

<p>Still the Englishman is a smart fellow.
That we must allow. Sometimes the English
came down to a very low altitude and
visited Boelcke in his quarters, upon which
they threw their bombs. They absolutely
challenged us to battle and never refused
fighting.</p>

<p>We had a delightful time with our chasing
squadron. The spirit of our leader animated
all his pupils. We trusted him blindly.
There was no possibility that one of us
would be left behind. Such a thought was
incomprehensible to us. Animated by that
spirit we gaily diminished the number of our
enemies.</p>

<p>On the day when Boelcke fell the squadron
had brought down forty opponents. By now
the number has been increased by more than
a hundred. Boelcke's spirit lives still among
his capable successors.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>


<div class='section'>
<i>Boelcke's Death. (28th October, 1916)</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>ONE day we were flying, once more
guided by Boelcke against the enemy.
We always had a wonderful feeling of security
when he was with us. After all he
was the one and only. The weather was
very gusty and there were many clouds.
There were no aeroplanes about except
fighting ones.</div>

<p>From a long distance we saw two impertinent
Englishmen in the air who actually
seemed to enjoy the terrible weather.
We were six and they were two. If they
had been twenty and if Boelcke had given
us the signal to attack we should not have
been at all surprised.</p>

<p>The struggle began in the usual way.
Boelcke tackled the one and I the other. I
had to let go because one of the German
machines got in my way. I looked around
and noticed Boelcke settling his victim about
two hundred yards away from me.</p>

<p>It was the usual thing. Boelcke would
shoot down his opponent and I had to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
on. Close to Boelcke flew a good friend of
his. It was an interesting struggle. Both
men were shooting. It was probable that
the Englishman would fall at any moment.
Suddenly I noticed an unnatural movement
of the two German flying machines. Immediately
I thought: Collision. I had not yet
seen a collision in the air. I had imagined
that it would look quite different. In reality,
what happened was not a collision. The
two machines merely touched one another.
However, if two machines go at the tremendous
pace of flying machines, the slightest
contact has the effect of a violent concussion.</p>

<p>Boelcke drew away from his victim and
descended in large curves. He did not seem
to be falling, but when I saw him descending
below me I noticed that part of his planes
had broken off. I could not see what
happened afterwards, but in the clouds
he lost an entire plane. Now his machine
was no longer steerable. It fell
accompanied all the time by Boelcke's
faithful friend.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>When we reached home we found the report
"Boelcke is dead!" had already arrived.
We could scarcely realize it.</p>

<p>The greatest pain was, of course, felt by
the man who had the misfortune to be involved
in the accident.</p>

<p>It is a strange thing that everybody who
met Boelcke imagined that he alone was his
true friend. I have made the acquaintance
of about forty men, each of whom imagined
that he alone was Boelcke's intimate. Each
imagined that he had the monopoly of
Boelcke's affections. Men whose names
were unknown to Boelcke believed that he
was particularly fond of them. This is a
curious phenomenon which I have never
noticed in anyone else. Boelcke had not a
personal enemy. He was equally polite to
everybody, making no differences.</p>

<p>The only one who was perhaps more intimate
with him than the others was the
very man who had the misfortune to be in
the accident which caused his death.</p>

<p>Nothing happens without God's will. That
is the only consolation which any of us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
can put to our souls during this war.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>My Eighth Victim</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>IN Boelcke's time eight was quite a respectable
number. Those who hear
nowadays of the colossal bags made by certain
aviators must feel convinced that it has
become easier to shoot down a machine. I
can assure those who hold that opinion that
the flying business is becoming more difficult
from month to month and even from
week to week. Of course, with the increasing
number of aeroplanes one gains increased
opportunities for shooting down
one's enemies, but at the same time, the
possibility of being shot down one's self increases.
The armament of our enemies is
steadily improving and their number is increasing.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
When Immelmann shot down his
first victim he had the good fortune to find
an opponent who carried not even a machine
gun. Such little innocents one finds nowadays
only at the training ground for beginners.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<p>On the ninth of November, 1916, I flew
towards the enemy with my little comrade
Immelmann,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> who then was eighteen years
old. We both were in Boelcke's squadron
of chasing aeroplanes. We had previously
met one another and had got on very well.
Comradeship is a most important thing. We
went to work. I had already bagged seven
enemies and Immelmann five. At that time
this was quite a lot.</p>

<p>Soon after our arrival at the front we
saw a squadron of bombing aeroplanes.
They were coming along with impertinent
assurance. They arrived in enormous numbers
as was usual during the Somme Battle.
I think there were about forty or fifty machines
approaching. I cannot give the exact
number. They had selected an object for
their bombs not far from our aerodrome. I
reached them when they had almost attained
their objective. I approached the last machine.
My first few shots incapacitated the
hostile machine gunner. Possibly they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
tickled the pilot, too. At any rate he resolved
to land with his bombs. I fired a
few more shots to accelerate his progress
downwards. He fell close to our flying
ground at Lagnicourt.</p>

<p>While I was fighting my opponent, Immelmann
had tackled another Englishman
and had brought him down in the same locality.
Both of us flew quickly home in
order to have a look at the machines we
had downed. We jumped into a motor car,
drove in the direction where our victims
lay and had to run along a distance through
the fields. It was very hot, therefore I unbuttoned
all my garments even the collar
and the shirt. I took off my jacket, left my
cap in the car but took with me a big stick.
My boots were miry up to the knees. I
looked like a tramp. I arrived in the vicinity
of my victim. In the meantime, a lot of
people had of course gathered around.</p>

<p>At one spot there was a group of officers.
I approached them, greeted them, and asked
the first one whom I met whether he could
tell me anything about the aspect of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
aerial battle. It is always interesting to find
out how a fight in the air looks to the people
down below. I was told that the English
machines had thrown bombs and that the
aeroplane that had come down was still
carrying its bombs.</p>

<p>The officer who gave me this information
took my arm, went with me to the other
officers, asked my name and introduced me
to them. I did not like it, for my attire was
rather disarranged. On the other hand, all
the officers looked as spic and span as on
parade. I was introduced to a personage
who impressed me rather strangely. I noticed
a General's trousers, an Order at the
neck, an unusually youthful face and undefinable
epaulettes. In short, the personage
seemed extraordinary to me. During our
conversation I buttoned my trousers and
collar and adopted a somewhat military
attitude.</p>

<p>I had no idea who the officer was. I took
my leave and went home again. In the evening
the telephone rang and I was told that
the undefinable somebody with whom I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
been talking had been His Royal Highness,
the Grand-Duke of Saxe-Coburg Gotha.</p>

<p>I was ordered to go to him. It was known
that the English had intended to throw
bombs on his headquarters. Apparently I
had helped to keep the aggressors away from
him. Therefore I was given the Saxe-Coburg
Gotha medal for bravery.</p>

<p>I always enjoy this adventure when I look
at the medal.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>Major Hawker</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>I&nbsp; WAS extremely proud when, one fine
day, I was informed that the airman
whom I had brought down on the twenty-third
of November, 1916, was the English
Immelmann.</div>

<p>In view of the character of our fight it was
clear to me that I had been tackling a flying
champion.</p>

<p>One day I was blithely flying to give chase
when I noticed three Englishmen who also
had apparently gone a-hunting. I noticed
that they were ogling me and as I felt much
inclination to have a fight I did not want to
disappoint them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>I was flying at a lower altitude. Consequently
I had to wait until one of my English
friends tried to drop on me. After a short
while on the three came sailing along and
attempted to tackle me in the rear. After
firing five shots he had to stop for I had
swerved in a sharp curve.</p>

<p>The Englishman tried to catch me up in
the rear while I tried to get behind him. So
we circled round and round like madmen
after one another at an altitude of about
10,000 feet.</p>

<p>First we circled twenty times to the left,
and then thirty times to the right. Each
tried to get behind and above the other.</p>

<p>Soon I discovered that I was not meeting
a beginner. He had not the slightest intention
of breaking off the fight. He was traveling
in a machine which turned beautifully.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
However, my own was better at rising than
his, and I succeeded at last in getting above
and beyond my English waltzing partner.</p>

<p>When we had got down to about 6,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
feet without having achieved anything in
particular, my opponent ought to have discovered
that it was time for him to take his
leave. The wind was favorable to me for
it drove us more and more towards the German
position. At last we were above Bapaume,
about half a mile behind the German
front. The impertinent fellow was full of
cheek and when we had got down to about
3,000 feet he merrily waved to me as if he
would say, "Well, how do you do?"</p>

<p>The circles which we made around one
another were so narrow that their diameter
was probably no more than 250 or 300 feet.
I had time to take a good look at my opponent.
I looked down into his carriage and
could see every movement of his head. If he
had not had his cap on I would have noticed
what kind of a face he was making.</p>

<p>My Englishman was a good sportsman,
but by and by the thing became a little too
hot for him. He had to decide whether he
would land on German ground or whether
he would fly back to the English lines. Of
course he tried the latter, after having endeavored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in vain to escape me by loopings
and such like tricks. At that time his first
bullets were flying around me, for hitherto
neither of us had been able to do any
shooting.</p>

<p>When he had come down to about three
hundred feet he tried to escape by flying in
a zig-zag course during which, as is well
known, it is difficult for an observer to shoot.
That was my most favorable moment. I followed
him at an altitude of from two hundred
and fifty feet to one hundred and fifty
feet, firing all the time. The Englishman
could not help falling. But the jamming of
my gun nearly robbed me of my success.</p>

<p>My opponent fell, shot through the head,
one hundred and fifty feet behind our line.
His machine gun was dug out of the ground
and it ornaments the entrance of my
dwelling.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><i>I Get the Ordre Pour le M&eacute;rite</i></div>


<div class='cap'>I&nbsp; HAD brought down my sixteenth victim,
and I had come to the head of the list
of all the flying chasers. I had obtained the
aim which I had set myself. In the previous
year my friend Lynker, with whom I was
training, had asked me: "What is your
object? What will you obtain by flying?"
I replied, jokingly, "I would like to be the
first of the chasers. That must be very fine."
That I should succeed in this I did not believe
myself. Other people also did not
expect my success. Boelcke is supposed to
have said, not to me personally&mdash;I have only
heard the report&mdash;when asked: "Which of
the fellows is likely to become a good
chaser?"&mdash;"That is the man!" pointing his
finger in my direction.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">THE FORTIETH RICHTHOFEN VICTIM</span>
</div>

<p>Boelcke and Immelmann were given the
<i>Ordre pour le M&eacute;rite</i> when they had brought
down their eighth aeroplane. I had downed
twice that number. The question was, what
would happen to me? I was very curious.
It was rumored that I was to be given command
of a chasing squadron.</p>

<p>One fine day a telegram arrived, which
stated: "Lieutenant von Richthofen is appointed
Commander of the Eleventh Chasing
Squadron."</p>

<p>I must say I was annoyed. I had learnt
to work so well with my comrades of
Boelcke's Squadron and now I had to begin
all over again working hand in hand with
different people. It was a beastly nuisance.
Besides I should have preferred the <i>Ordre
pour le M&eacute;rite</i>.</p>

<p>Two days later, when we were sitting sociably
together, we men of Boelcke's Squadron,
celebrating my departure, a telegram
from Headquarters arrived. It stated that
His Majesty had graciously condescended to
give me the <i>Ordre pour le M&eacute;rite</i>. Of course
my joy was tremendous.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>I had never imagined that it would be so
delightful to command a chasing squadron.
Even in my dreams I had not imagined that
there would ever be a Richthofen's squadron
of aeroplanes.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>Le Petit Rouge</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>IT occurred to me to have my packing case
painted all over in staring red. The result
was that everyone got to know my red
bird. My opponents also seemed to have
heard of the color transformation.</div>

<p>During a fight on quite a different section
of the Front I had the good fortune to
shoot into a Vickers' two-seater which
peacefully photographed the German artillery
position. My friend, the photographer,
had not the time to defend himself. He had
to make haste to get down upon firm ground
for his machine began to give suspicious indications
of fire. When we airmen notice
that phenomenon in an enemy plane, we say:
"He stinks!" As it turned out it was really
so. When the machine was coming to earth
it burst into flames.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>I felt some human pity for my opponent
and had resolved not to cause him to fall
down but merely to compel him to land. I
did so particularly because I had the impression
that my opponent was wounded for
he did not fire a single shot.</p>

<p>When I had got down to an altitude of
about fifteen hundred feet engine trouble
compelled me to land without making any
curves. The result was very comical. My
enemy with his burning machine landed
smoothly while I, his victor, came down next
to him in the barbed wire of our trenches and
my machine overturned.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The two Englishmen who were not a little
surprised at my collapse, greeted me like
sportsmen. As mentioned before, they had
not fired a shot and they could not understand
why I had landed so clumsily. They
were the first two Englishmen whom I had
brought down alive. Consequently, it gave
me particular pleasure to talk to them. I
asked them whether they had previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
seen my machine in the air, and one of them
replied, "Oh, yes. I know your machine very
well. We call it 'Le Petit Rouge'."</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>English and French Flying.<br />
(February, 1917)</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>I&nbsp; WAS trying to compete with Boelcke's
squadron. Every evening we compared
our bags. However, Boelcke's pupils are
smart rascals. I cannot get ahead of them.
The utmost one can do is to draw level with
them. The Boelcke section has an advantage
over my squadron of one hundred aeroplanes
downed. I must allow them to retain
it. Everything depends on whether we have
for opponents those French tricksters or
those daring rascals, the English. I prefer
the English. Frequently their daring can
only be described as stupidity. In their eyes
it may be pluck and daring.</div>

<p>The great thing in air fighting is that the
decisive factor does not lie in trick flying
but solely in the personal ability and energy
of the aviator. A flying man may be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to loop and do all the stunts imaginable and
yet he may not succeed in shooting down a
single enemy. In my opinion the aggressive
spirit is everything and that spirit is very
strong in us Germans. Hence we shall
always retain the domination of the air.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The French have a different character.
They like to put traps and to attack their
opponents unawares. That cannot easily be
done in the air. Only a beginner can be
caught and one cannot set traps because an
aeroplane cannot hide itself. The invisible
aeroplane has not yet been discovered.
Sometimes, however, the Gaelic blood asserts
itself. The Frenchmen will then
attack. But the French attacking spirit is
like bottled lemonade. It lacks tenacity.</p>

<p>The Englishmen, on the other hand, one
notices that they are of Germanic blood.
Sportsmen easily take to flying, and Englishmen
see in flying nothing but a sport. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
take a perfect delight in looping the loop,
flying on their back, and indulging in other
stunts for the benefit of our soldiers in the
trenches. All these tricks may impress
people who attend a Sports Meeting, but the
public at the battle-front is not as appreciative
of these things. It demands higher
qualifications than trick flying. Therefore,
the blood of English pilots will have to flow
in streams.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>I Am Shot Down.<br />
(Middle of March, 1917)</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>I&nbsp; HAVE had an experience which might
perhaps be described as being shot down.
At the same time, I call shot down only when
one falls down. To-day I got into trouble
but I escaped with a whole skin.</div>

<p>I was flying with the squadron and noticed
an opponent who also was flying in a squadron.
It happened above the German artillery
position in the neighborhood of Lens. I had
to fly quite a distance to get there. It tickles
ones nerves to fly towards the enemy, especially
when one can see him from a long
distance and when several minutes must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
elapse before one can start fighting. I imagine
that at such a moment my face turns
a little pale, but unfortunately I have never
had a mirror with me. I like that feeling for
it is a wonderful nerve stimulant. One
observes the enemy from afar. One has
recognized that his squadron is really an
enemy formation. One counts the number of
the hostile machines and considers whether
the conditions are favorable or unfavorable.
A factor of enormous importance is whether
the wind forces me away from or towards
our Front. For instance, I once shot down
an Englishman. I fired the fatal shot above
the English position. However, the wind
was so strong that his machine came down
close to the German captive balloons.</p>

<p>We Germans had five machines. Our opponents
were three times as numerous. The
English flew about like midges. It is not
easy to disperse a swarm of machines which
fly together in good order. It is impossible
for a single machine to do it. It is extremely
difficult for several aeroplanes, particularly
if the difference in number is as great as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
was in this case. However, one feels such
a superiority over the enemy that one does
not doubt of success for a moment.</p>

<p>The aggressive spirit, the offensive, is the
chief thing everywhere in war, and the air
is no exception. However, the enemy had
the same idea. I noticed that at once. As
soon as they observed us they turned round
and attacked us. Now we five had to look
sharp. If one of them should fall there
might be a lot of trouble for all of us. We
went closer together and allowed the foreign
gentlemen to approach us.</p>

<p>I watched whether one of the fellows
would hurriedly take leave of his colleagues.
There! One of them is stupid enough to
depart alone. I can reach him and I say to
myself, "That man is lost." Shouting aloud,
I am after him. I have come up to him or
at least am getting very near him. He starts
shooting prematurely, which shows that he
is nervous. So I say to myself, "Go on shooting.
You won't hit me." He shot with a
kind of ammunition which ignites. So I
could see his shots passing me. I felt as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
I were sitting in front of a gigantic watering
pot. The sensation was not pleasant. Still,
the English usually shoot with their beastly
stuff, and so we must try and get accustomed
to it.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> One can get accustomed to anything.
At the moment I think I laughed aloud. But
soon I got a lesson. When I had approached
the Englishman quite closely, when I had
come to a distance of about three hundred
feet, I got ready for firing, aimed and gave
a few trial shots. The machine guns were
in order. The decision would be there before
long. In my mind's eye I saw my enemy
dropping.</p>

<p>My former excitement was gone. In such
a position one thinks quite calmly and collectedly
and weighs the probabilities of
hitting and of being hit. Altogether the
fight itself is the least exciting part of the
business as a rule. He who gets excited in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
fighting is sure to make mistakes. He will
never get his enemy down. Besides calmness
is, after all, a matter of habit. At any
rate in this case I did not make a mistake.
I approached my man up to fifty yards. Then
I fired some well aimed shots and thought
that I was bound to be successful. That was
my idea. But suddenly I heard a tremendous
bang, when I had scarcely fired ten cartridges.
Presently again something hit my
machine. It became clear to me that I had
been hit or rather my machine. At the same
time I noticed a fearful benzine stench and
I observed that the motor was running
slack. The Englishman noticed it, too, for
he started shooting with redoubled energy
while I had to stop it.</p>

<p>I went right down. Instinctively I
switched off the engine and indeed it was
high time to do this. When a pilot's benzine
tank has been perforated, and when the infernal
liquid is squirting around his legs, the
danger of fire is very great. In front is an
explosion engine of more than 150 h. p. which
is red hot. If a single drop of benzine should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
fall on it the whole machine would be in
flames.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>I left in the air a thin white cloud. I knew
its meaning from my enemies. Its appearance
is the first sign of a coming explosion.
I was at an altitude of nine thousand feet
and had to travel a long distance to get
down. By the kindness of Providence my
engine stopped running. I have no idea with
what rapidity I went downward. At any
rate the speed was so great that I could not
put my head out of the machine without
being pressed back by the rush of air.</p>

<p>Soon I lost sight of my enemy. I had
only time to see what my four comrades
were doing while I was dropping to the
ground. They were still fighting. Their
machine-guns and those of their opponents
could be heard. Suddenly I notice a rocket.
Is it a signal of the enemy? No, it cannot
be. The light is too great for a rocket. Evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
a machine is on fire. What machine?
The burning machine looks exactly as if it
were one of our own. No! Praise the Lord,
it is one of the enemy's! Who can have shot
him down? Immediately afterwards a second
machine drops out and falls perpendicularly
to the ground, turning, turning, turning
exactly as I did, but suddenly it recovers
its balance. It flies straight towards me.
It also is an Albatros. No doubt it had the
same experience as I had.</p>

<p>I had fallen to an altitude of perhaps one
thousand feet and had to look out for a
landing. Now such a sudden landing usually
leads to breakages and as these are occasionally
serious it was time to look out. I
found a meadow. It was not very large but
it just sufficed if I used due caution. Besides
it was favorably situated on the high
road near H&eacute;nin-Li&eacute;tard. There I meant to
land.</p>

<p>Everything went as desired and my first
thought was, "What has become of the other
fellow." He landed a few kilometers from
the spot where I had come to the ground.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>I had ample time to inspect the damage.
My machine had been hit a number of times.
The shot which caused me to give up the
fight had gone through both benzine tanks. I
had not a drop of benzine left and the engine
itself had also been damaged by shots. It
was a pity for it had worked so well.</p>

<p>I let my legs dangle out of the machine
and probably made a very silly face. In a
moment I was surrounded by a large crowd
of soldiers. Then came an officer. He was
quite out of breath. He was terribly excited!
No doubt something fearful had happened
to him. He rushed towards me,
gasped for air and asked: "I hope that
nothing has happened to you. I have followed
the whole affair and am terribly excited!
Good Lord, it looked awful!" I assured
him that I felt quite well, jumped down
from the side of my machine and introduced
myself to him. Of course he did not understand
a particle of my name. However, he
invited me to go in his motor car to H&eacute;nin-Li&eacute;tard
where he was quartered. He was
an Engineer Officer.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>We were sitting in the motor and were
commencing our ride. My host was still
extraordinarily excited. Suddenly he jumped
up and asked: "Good Lord, but where is your
chauffeur?" At first I did not quite understand
what he meant. Probably I looked
puzzled. Then it dawned upon me that he
thought that I was the observer of a two-seater
and that he asked after the fate of
my pilot. I pulled myself together and said
in the dryest tones: "I always drive myself."
Of course the word "drive" is absolutely
taboo among the flying men.</p>

<p>An aviator does not drive, he flies. In the
eyes of the kind gentleman I had obviously
lost caste when he discovered that I "drove"
my own aeroplane. The conversation began
to slacken.</p>

<p>We arrived in his quarters. I was still
dressed in my dirty and oily leather jacket
and had round my neck a thick wrap. On
our journey he had of course asked me a
tremendous number of questions. Altogether
he was far more excited than I was.</p>

<p>When we got to his diggings he forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
me to lie down on the sofa, or at least he
tried to force me because, he argued, I was
bound to be terribly done up through my
fight. I assured him that this was not my
first aerial battle but he did not, apparently,
give me much credence. Probably I did not
look very martial.</p>

<p>After we had been talking for some time
he asked me of course the celebrated question:
"Have you ever brought down a machine?"
As I said before he had probably
not understood my name. So I answered
nonchalantly: "Oh, yes! I have done so
now and then." He replied: "Indeed! Perhaps
you have shot down two?" I answered:
"No. Not two but twenty-four." He
smiled, repeated his question and gave me
to understand that, when he was speaking
about shooting down an aeroplane, he meant
not shooting <i>at</i> an aeroplane but shooting
<i>into</i> an aeroplane in such a manner that it
would fall to the ground and remain there.
I immediately assured him that I entirely
shared his conception of the meaning of the
words "shooting down."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Now I had completely lost caste with him.
He was convinced that I was a fearful liar.
He left me sitting where I was and told me
that a meal would be served in an hour. If
I liked I could join in. I accepted his invitation
and slept soundly for an hour. Then
we went to the Officers' Club. Arrived at
the club I was glad to find that I was wearing
the <i>Ordre pour le M&eacute;rite</i>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I had no uniform jacket underneath
my greasy leather coat but only a
waistcoat. I apologized for being so badly
dressed. Suddenly my good chief discovered
on me the <i>Ordre pour le M&eacute;rite</i>. He
was speechless with surprise and assured me
that he did not know my name. I gave him
my name once more. Now it seemed to dawn
upon him that he had heard my name before.
He feasted me with oysters and champagne
and I did gloriously until at last my orderly
arrived and fetched me with my car. I
learned from him that comrade Lubbert had
once more justified his nickname. He was
generally called "The bullet-catcher" for his
machine suffered badly in every fight. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
it was hit sixty-four times. Yet he had not
been wounded. This time he had received
a glancing shot on the chest and he was by
this time in hospital. I flew his machine to
port. Unfortunately this excellent officer,
who promised to become another Boelcke,
died a few weeks later&mdash;a hero's death for
the Fatherland.</p>

<p>In the evening I could assure my kind host
of H&eacute;nin-Li&eacute;tard that I had increased my
"bag" to twenty-five.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'><i>A Flying-Man's Adventure.<br />
(End of March, 1917)</i></div>


<div class='cap'>THE name "Siegfried position" is probably
known to every young man in Germany.
During the time when we withdrew
towards the Siegfried line the activity in
the air was of course very great. We allowed
our enemies to occupy the territory
which we had evacuated but we did not
allow them to occupy the air as well. The
chaser squadron which Boelcke had trained
looked after the English flying men. The
English had hitherto fought a war of position
in the air and they ventured to abandon
it for a war of movement only with the utmost
caution.</div>

<p>That was the time when Prince Frederick
Charles gave his life for the Fatherland.</p>

<p>In the course of a hunting expedition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the Boelcke Chaser Squadron, Lieutenant
Voss<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> had defeated an Englishman in an
aerial duel. He was forced to go down to
the ground and landed in neutral territory
between the lines, in No Man's Land. In
this particular case we had abandoned a
stretch of territory but the enemy had not
yet occupied it. Only English and German
patrols were about in the unoccupied zone.
The English flying machine was standing
between the two lines. Our good Englishman
probably believed that the ground was
already in English possession and he was
justified in thinking so.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Voss was of a different opinion.
Without a moment's hesitation he
landed close to his victim. With great rapidity
he transferred the Englishman's machine-guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and other useful things to his
own aeroplane, took a match and in a few
minutes the English machine stood in flames.
Then he waved smilingly from his victorious
aeroplane to the English who were rushing
along from all sides and was off.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>My First Double Event</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>THE second of April, 1917, was a very
warm day for my Squadron. From my
quarters I could clearly hear the drum-fire
of the guns which was again particularly
violent.</div>

<p>I was still in bed when my orderly rushed
into the room and exclaimed: "Sir, the
English are here!" Sleepy as I was, I looked
out of the window and, really, there were
my dear friends circling over the flying
ground. I jumped out of my bed and into
my clothes in a jiffy. My Red Bird had been
pulled out and was ready for starting. My
mechanics knew that I should probably not
allow such a favorable moment to go by unutilized.
Everything was ready. I snatched
up my furs and then went off.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>I was the last to start. My comrades were
much nearer to the enemy. I feared that my
prey would escape me, that I should have
to look on from a distance while the others
were fighting. Suddenly one of the impertinent
fellows tried to drop down upon me.
I allowed him to come near and then we
started a merry quadrille. Sometimes my
opponent flew on his back and sometimes he
did other tricks. He had a double-seated
chaser. I was his master and very soon I
recognized that he could not escape me.</p>

<p>During an interval in the fighting I convinced
myself that we were alone. It followed
that the victory would accrue to him
who was calmest, who shot best and who
had the clearest brain in a moment of danger.
After a short time I got him beneath
me without seriously hurting him with my
gun. We were at least two kilometers from
the front. I thought he intended to land but
there I had made a mistake. Suddenly,
when he was only a few yards above the
ground, he once more went off on a straight
course. He tried to escape me. That was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
too bad. I attacked him again and I went
so low that I feared I should touch the roofs
of the houses of the village beneath me.
The Englishman defended himself up to the
last moment. At the very end I felt that
my engine had been hit. Still I did not let
go. He had to fall. He rushed at full speed
right into a block of houses.</p>

<p>There was little left to be done. This was
once more a case of splendid daring. He defended
himself to the last. However, in my
opinion he showed more foolhardiness than
courage. This was one of the cases where
one must differentiate between energy and
idiocy. He had to come down in any case
but he paid for his stupidity with his life.</p>

<p>I was delighted with the performance of
my red machine during its morning work
and returned to our quarters. My comrades
were still in the air and they were very
surprised, when, as we met at breakfast,
I told them that I had scored my thirty-second
machine.</p>

<p>A very young Lieutenant had "bagged"
his first aeroplane. We were all very merry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and prepared everything for further battles.</p>

<p>I then went and groomed myself. I had
not had time to do it previously. I was
visited by a dear friend, Lieutenant Voss of
Boelcke's Squadron. We chatted. Voss had
downed on the previous day his twenty-third
machine. He was next to me on the list and
is at present my most redoubtable competitor.</p>

<p>When he started to fly home I offered to
accompany him part of the way. We went
on a roundabout way over the Fronts. The
weather had turned so bad that we could
not hope to find any more game.</p>

<p>Beneath us there were dense clouds. Voss
did not know the country and he began to
feel uncomfortable. When we passed above
Arras I met my brother who also is in my
squadron and who had lost his way. He
joined us. Of course he recognized me at
once by the color of my machine.</p>

<p>Suddenly we saw a squadron approaching
from the other side. Immediately the
thought occurred to me: "Now comes number
thirty-three." Although there were nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Englishmen and although they were on their
own territory they preferred to avoid battle.
I thought that perhaps it would be better
for me to re-paint my machine. Nevertheless
we caught them up. The important
thing in aeroplanes is that they are speedy.</p>

<p>I was nearest to the enemy and attacked
the man to the rear. To my greatest delight
I noticed that he accepted battle and my
pleasure was increased when I discovered
that his comrades deserted him. So I had
once more a single fight.</p>

<p>It was a fight similar to the one which I
had had in the morning. My opponent did
not make matters easy for me. He knew the
fighting business and it was particularly
awkward for me that he was a good shot.
To my great regret that was quite clear to
me.</p>

<p>A favorable wind came to my aid. It drove
both of us into the German lines.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> My opponent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
discovered that the matter was not so
simple as he had imagined. So he plunged
and disappeared in a cloud. He had nearly
saved himself.</p>

<p>I plunged after him and dropped out of
the cloud and, as luck would have it, found
myself close behind him. I fired and he fired
without any tangible result. At last I hit
him. I noticed a ribbon of white benzine
vapor. He had to land for his engine had
come to a stop.</p>

<p>He was a stubborn fellow. He was bound
to recognize that he had lost the game. If
he continued shooting I could kill him, for
meanwhile we had dropped to an altitude
of about nine hundred feet. However, the
Englishman defended himself exactly as did
his countryman in the morning. He fought
until he landed. When he had come to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
ground I flew over him at an altitude of
about thirty feet in order to ascertain
whether I had killed him or not. What did
the rascal do? He took his machine-gun
and shot holes into my machine.</p>

<p>Afterwards Voss told me if that had happened
to him he would have shot the airman
on the ground. As a matter of fact I ought
to have done so for he had not surrendered.
He was one of the few fortunate fellows
who escaped with their lives.</p>

<p>I felt very merry, flew home and celebrated
my thirty-third aeroplane.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>




<h2>XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><i>My Record-Day</i></div>


<div class='cap'>THE weather was glorious. We were
ready for starting. I had as a visitor a
gentleman who had never seen a fight in the air
or anything resembling it and he had just
assured me that it would tremendously interest
him to witness an aerial battle.</div>

<p>We climbed into our machines and
laughed heartily at our visitor's eagerness.
Friend Sch&auml;fer<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> thought that we might give
him some fun. We placed him before a telescope
and off we went.</p>

<p>The day began well. We had scarcely
flown to an altitude of six thousand feet
when an English squadron of five machines
was seen coming our way. We attacked
them by a rush as if we were cavalry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the hostile squadron lay destroyed on the
ground. None of our men was even
wounded. Of our enemies three had plunged
to the ground and two had come down in
flames.</p>

<p>The good fellow down below was not a
little surprised. He had imagined that the
affair would look quite different, that it
would be far more dramatic. He thought
the whole encounter had looked quite harmless
until suddenly some machines came
falling down looking like rockets. I have
gradually become accustomed to seeing machines
falling down, but I must say it impressed
me very deeply when I saw the first
Englishman fall and I have often seen the
event again in my dreams.</p>

<p>As the day had begun so propitiously we
sat down and had a decent breakfast. All
of us were as hungry as wolves. In the
meantime our machines were again made
ready for starting. Fresh cartridges were
got and then we went off again.</p>

<p>In the evening we could send off the proud
report: "Six German machines have destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
thirteen hostile aeroplanes."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Boelcke's Squadron had only once been
able to make a similar report. At that time
we had shot down eight machines. To-day
one of us had brought low four of his opponents.
The hero was a Lieutenant Wolff,
a delicate-looking little fellow in whom nobody
could have suspected a redoubtable
hero. My brother had destroyed two, Sch&auml;fer
two, Festner two and I three.</p>

<p>We went to bed in the evening tremendously
proud but also terribly tired. On the
following day we read with noisy approval
about our deeds of the previous day in the
official communiqu&eacute;. On the next day we
downed eight hostile machines.</p>

<p>A very amusing thing occurred. One of
the Englishmen whom we had shot down
and whom we had made a prisoner was talking
with us. Of course he inquired after the
Red Aeroplane. It is not unknown even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
among the troops in the trenches and is
called by them "le diable rouge." In the
Squadron to which he belonged there
was a rumor that the Red Machine was
occupied by a girl, by a kind of Jeanne
d'Arc. He was intensely surprised when
I assured him that the supposed girl was
standing in front of him. He did not
intend to make a joke. He was actually
convinced that only a girl could sit in
the extravagantly painted machine.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>"Moritz"</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>THE most beautiful being in all creation
is the genuine Danish hound, my
little lap-dog, my Moritz. I bought him in
Ostend from a brave Belgian for five marks.
His mother was a beautiful animal and one
of his fathers also was pure-bred. I am
convinced of that. I could select one of the
litter and I chose the prettiest. Zeumer took
another puppy and called it Max.</div>

<p>Max came to a sudden end. He was run
over by a motor car. Moritz flourished exceedingly.
He slept with me in my bed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
received a most excellent education. He
never left me while I was in Ostend and
obtained my entire affection. Month by
month Moritz grew, and gradually my tender
little lap-dog became a colossal, big
beast.</p>

<p>Once I even took him with me. He was
my first observer. He behaved very sensibly.
He seemed much interested in everything
and looked at the world from above.
Only my mechanics were dissatisfied when
they had to clean the machine. Afterwards
Moritz was very merry.</p>

<p>Moritz is more than a year old and he is
still as child-like as if he were still in his
teens. He is very fond of playing billiards.
In doing this he has destroyed many billiard
balls and particularly many a billiard cloth.
He has a great passion for the chase. My
mechanics are highly satisfied with his sporting
inclinations for he has caught for them
many a nice hare. I do not much approve
of his hunting proclivities. Consequently he
gets a whacking if I catch him at it.</p>

<p>He has a silly peculiarity. He likes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
accompany the flying machines at the start.
Frequently the normal death of a flying-man's
dog is death from the propeller. One
day he rushed in front of a flying-machine
which had been started. The aeroplane
caught him up and a beautiful propeller
was smashed to bits. Moritz howled
terribly and a measure which I had hitherto
omitted was taken. I had always
refused to have his ears cut. One of his
ears was cut off by the propeller. A long
ear and a short ear do not go well together.</p>

<p>Moritz has taken a very sensible view of
the world-war and of our enemies. When in
the summer of 1916 he saw for the first time
Russian natives&mdash;the train had stopped and
Moritz was being taken for a walk&mdash;he
chased the Russian crowd with loud barking.
He has no great opinion of Frenchmen
although he is, after all, a Belgian.
Once, when I had settled in new quarters, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
ordered the people to clean the house. When
I came back in the evening nothing had been
done. I got angry and asked the Frenchman
to come and see me. When he opened the
door Moritz greeted him rather brusquely.
Immediately I understood why no cleaning
had been done.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>The English Attack Our Aerodrome</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>NIGHTS in which the full moon is shining
are most suitable for night flying.</div>

<p>During the full moon nights of the month
of April our English friends were particularly
industrious. This was during the
Battle of Arras. Probably they had found
out that we had comfortably installed ourselves
on a beautiful large flying ground at
Douai.</p>

<p>One night when we were in the Officers'
Mess the telephone started ringing and we
were told: "The English are coming." There
was a great hullabaloo. We had bomb-proof
shelters. They had been got ready by
our excellent Simon. Simon is our architect,
surveyor and builder.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>We dived down into shelter and we heard
actually, at first a very gentle humming and
then the noise of engines. The searchlights
had apparently got notice at the same time
as we, for they started getting ready.</p>

<p>The nearest enemy was still too far away
to be attacked. We were colossally merry.
The only thing we feared was that the English
would not succeed in finding our aerodrome.
To find some fixed spot at night is
by no means easy. It was particularly difficult
to find us because our aerodrome was
not situated on an important highway or
near water or a railway, by which one can
be guided during one's flight at night.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The
Englishmen were apparently flying at a
great altitude. At first they circled around
our entire establishment. We began to
think that they had given up and were looking
for another objective. Suddenly we noticed
that the nearest one had switched off
his engine. So he was coming lower. Wolff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
said: "Now the matter is becoming serious."</p>

<p>We had two carbines and began shooting
at the Englishman. We could not see him.
Still the noise of our shooting was a sedative
to our nerves.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was taken up by the searchlights.
There was shouting all over the flying
ground. Our friend was sitting in a prehistoric
packing case.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> We could clearly
recognize the type. He was half a mile
away from us and was flying straight towards
us.</p>

<p>He went lower and lower. At last he had
come down to an altitude of about three hundred
feet. Then he started his engine again
and came straight towards the spot where
we were standing.</p>

<p>Wolff thought that he took an interest in
the other side of our establishment and before
long the first bomb fell and it was followed
by a number of other missiles.</p>

<p>Our friend amused us with very pretty
fireworks. They could have frightened only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
a coward. Broadly speaking, I find that
bomb-throwing at night has only a moral
effect. Those who are easily frightened are
strongly affected when bombs fall at night.
The others don't care.</p>

<p>We were much amused at the Englishman's
performance and thought the English
would come quite often on a visit. The flying
piano dropped its bombs at last from
an altitude of one hundred and fifty feet.
That was rather impertinent for in a moonlit
night I think I can hit a wild pig at one
hundred and fifty feet with a rifle. Why
then should I not succeed in hitting the Englishman?
It would have been a novelty to
down an English airman from the ground.</p>

<p>From above I had already had the honor
of downing a number of Englishmen, but I
had never tried to tackle an aviator from
below.</p>

<p>When the Englishman had gone we went
back to mess and discussed among ourselves
how we should receive the English should
they pay us another visit on the following
night. In the course of the next day our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
orderlies and other fellows were made to
work with great energy. They had to ram
into the ground piles which were to be used
as a foundation for machine guns during the
coming night.</p>

<p>We went to the butts and tried the English
machine guns which we had taken from
the enemy, arranged the sights for night
shooting and were very curious as to what
was going to happen. I will not betray the
number of our machine guns. Anyhow, they
were to be sufficient for the purpose. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Everyone'">Every one</ins>
of my officers was armed with one.</p>

<p>We were again sitting at mess. Of course
we were discussing the problem of night
fliers. Suddenly an orderly rushed in shouting:
"They are there! They are there!" and
disappeared in the next bomb-proof in his
scanty attire. We all rushed to our machine
guns. Some of the men who were
known to be good shots, had also been given
a machine gun. All the rest were provided
with carbines. The whole squadron was
armed to the teeth to give a warm reception
to our kindly visitors.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>The first Englishman arrived, exactly as
on the previous evening, at a very great altitude.
He went then down to one hundred
and fifty feet and to our greatest joy began
making for the place where our barracks
were. He got into the glare of the searchlight.</p>

<p>When he was only three hundred yards
away someone fired the first shot and all the
rest of us joined in. A rush of cavalry or
of storming troops could not have been met
more efficiently than the attack of that single
impertinent individual flying at one hundred
and fifty feet.</p>

<p>Quick firing from many guns received
him. Of course he could not hear the noise
of the machine guns. The roar of his motor
prevented that. However, he must have
seen the flashes of our guns. Therefore I
thought it tremendously plucky that our
man did not swerve, but continued going
straight ahead in accordance with his plan.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
<p>At the moment he was perpendicularly
above us we jumped quickly into our bomb-proof.
It would have been too silly for flying
men to die by a rotten bomb.</p>

<p>As soon as he had passed over our heads
we rushed out again and fired after him
with our machine guns and rifles.</p>

<p>Friend Sch&auml;fer asserted that he had hit
the man. Sch&auml;fer is quite a good shot. Still,
in this case I did not believe him. Besides,
everyone of us had as good a chance at making
a hit as he had.</p>

<p>We had achieved something, for the
enemy had dropped his bombs rather aimlessly
owing to our shooting. One of them,
it is true, had exploded only a few yards
from the "petit rouge," but had not hurt
him.</p>

<p>During the night the fun recommenced
several times. I was already in bed, fast
asleep, when I heard in a dream anti-aircraft
firing. I woke up and discovered that the
dream was reality. One of the Englishmen
flew at so low an altitude over my habitation
that in my fright I pulled the blanket over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
my head. The next moment I heard an incredible
bang just outside my window. The
panes had fallen a victim to the bomb. I
rushed out of my room in my shirt in order
to fire a few shots after him. They were
firing from everywhere. Unfortunately, I
had overslept my opportunity.</p>

<p>The next morning we were extremely surprised
and delighted to discover that we had
shot down from the ground no fewer than
three Englishmen. They had landed not far
from our aerodrome and had been made
prisoners.</p>

<p>As a rule we had hit the engines and had
forced the airmen to come down on our side
of the Front. After all, Sch&auml;fer was possibly
right in his assertion. At any rate, we
were very well satisfied with our success.
The English were distinctly less satisfied for
they preferred avoiding our base. It was a
pity that they gave us a wide berth, for they
gave us lots of fun. Let us hope that they
come back to us next month.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>




<h2>XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><i>Sch&auml;fer Lands Between the Lines</i></div>


<div class='cap'>WE went on a shooting expedition on the
twentieth of April. We came home
very late and lost Sch&auml;fer on the way.</div>

<p>Of course everyone hoped that he would
come to hand before dark. It struck nine,
it struck ten, but no Sch&auml;fer was visible. His
benzine could not last so long. Consequently,
he had landed somewhere, for no
one was willing to admit that he had been
shot down. No one dared to mention the
possibility. Still, everyone was afraid for
him.</p>

<p>The ubiquitous telephone was set in motion
in order to find out whether a flying
man had come down anywhere. Nobody
could give us information. No Division and
no Brigade had seen anything of him. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
felt very uncomfortable. At last we went to
bed. All of us were perfectly convinced
that he would turn up in the end.</p>

<p>At two o'clock, after midnight, I was suddenly
awakened. The telephone orderly,
beaming with pleasure, reported to me:
"Sch&auml;fer is in the Village of Y. and would
like to be fetched home."</p>

<p>The next morning when we were sitting
at breakfast the door opened and my dear
pilot stood before me. His clothes were as
filthy as those of an infantryman who has
fought at Arras for a fortnight. He was
greeted with a general Hurrah! Sch&auml;fer was
tremendously happy and elated and tremendously
excited about his adventure. When
he had finished his breakfast he told us the
following tale:</p>

<p>"I was flying along the front intending to
return home. Suddenly I noticed far below
me something that looked like an infantry
flier. I attacked him, shot him down, and
meant to fly back. However, the English in
the trenches did not mean me to get away
and started peppering me like anything. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
salvation lay in the rapidity of my machine,
for those rascals, of course, would forget
that they had to aim far in front of me if
they wished to hit me.</p>

<p>"I was at an altitude of perhaps six hundred
feet. Suddenly, I heard a smash and
my engine stopped running. There was
nothing to do but to land. I asked myself
whether I should be able to get away from
the English position. It seemed very questionable.
The English noticed my predicament
and started shooting like mad.</p>

<p>"As my engine was no longer running I
could hear every single shot. The position
became awkward. I came down and landed.
Before my machine had come to a standstill
they squirted upon me heaps of bullets from
machine guns in the hedge of the village of
Monchy near Arras. My machine became
splashed with bullets.</p>

<p>"I jumped out of it and down into the
first shell hole. Squatting there I reflected
and tried to realize exactly where I was.
Gradually it became clear to me that I had
landed outside the English lines, but cursedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
near them. Happily it was rather late
in the evening and that was my salvation.</p>

<p>"Before long the first shell came along.
Of course they were gas shells and I had no
mask with me. My eyes started watering
like anything. Before darkness set in the
English ascertained the distance of the spot
where I had landed with machine guns. Part
of them aimed at my machine and part at
my shell crater. The bullets constantly hit
its rim.</p>

<p>"In order to quiet my nerves I lit a cigarette.
Then I took off my heavy fur coat and
prepared everything for a leap and a run.
Every minute seemed to me an hour.</p>

<p>"Gradually it became dark, but only very
gradually. Around me I heard partridges
giving a concert. As an experienced shot I
recognized from their voices that they felt
quite happy and contented, that there was
no danger of my being surprised in my hiding
place.</p>

<p>"At last it became quite dark. Suddenly
and quite close to me a couple of partridges
flew up. A second couple followed. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
obvious that danger was approaching. No
doubt a patrol was on the way to wish me
a happy evening.</p>

<p>"I had no time to lose. Now or never.
First I crept very cautiously on my chest
from shell hole to shell hole. After creeping
industriously for about an hour and a half
I noticed I was nearing humans. Were they
English or were they Germans? They came
nearer and I could almost have fallen round
their necks, when I discovered our own
musketeers. They were a German patrol
who were nosing about in No Man's Land.</p>

<p>"One of the men conducted me to the Commander
of his Company. I was told that in
the evening I had landed about fifty yards
in front of the enemy lines and that our infantry
had given me up for lost. I had a
good supper and then I started on my way
home. Behind me there was far more shooting
than in front of me. Every path, every
trench, every bush, every hollow, was
under enemy fire. The English attacked on
the next morning, and consequently, they
had to begin their artillery preparation the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
evening before. So I had chosen an unfavorable
day for my enterprise. I reached the
first telephone only at two o'clock in the
morning when I 'phoned to the Squadron."</p>

<p>We were all very happy to have our Sch&auml;fer
again with us. He went to bed. Any
other man would have taken a rest from
flying for twenty-four hours. But on the
afternoon of this very day friend Sch&auml;fer
attacked a low flying B. E. above Monchy.</p>


<div class='section'>
<i>The Anti-Richthofen Squadron</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>THE English had hit upon a splendid joke.
They intended to catch me or to bring
me down. For that purpose they had actually
organized a special squadron which flew
about in that part which we frequented as
a rule. We discovered its particular aim by
the fact that its aggressive activity was
principally directed against our red machines.</div>

<p>I would say that all the machines of the
squadron had been painted red because our
English friends had by-and-by perceived that
I was sitting in a blood-red band-box. Suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
there were quite a lot of red machines
and the English opened their eyes wide when
one fine day they saw a dozen red barges
steaming along instead of a single one. Our
new trick did not prevent them from making
an attempt at attacking us. I preferred their
new tactics. It is better that one's customers
come to one's shop than to have to look
for them abroad.</p>

<p>We flew to the front hoping to find our
enemy. After about twenty minutes the
first arrived and attacked us. That had not
happened to us for a long time. The English
had abandoned their celebrated offensive
tactics to some extent. They had found them
somewhat too expensive.</p>

<p>Our aggressors were three Spad one-seater
machines. Their occupants thought
themselves very superior to us because of
the excellence of their apparatus. Wolff, my
brother and I, were flying together. We
were three against three. That was as it
ought to be.</p>

<p>Immediately at the beginning of the encounter
the aggressive became a defensive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Our superiority became clear. I tackled my
opponent and could see how my brother and
Wolff handled each his own enemy. The
usual waltzing began. We were circling
around one another. A favorable wind came
to our aid. It drove us, fighting, away from
the front in the direction of Germany.</p>

<p>My man was the first who fell down. I
suppose I had smashed up his engine. At
any rate, he made up his mind to land. I no
longer gave pardon to him. Therefore, I
attacked him a second time and the consequence
was that his whole machine went
to pieces. His planes dropped off like pieces
of paper and the body of the machine fell
like a stone, burning fiercely. It dropped
into a morass. It was impossible to dig it out
and I have never discovered the name of my
opponent. He had disappeared. Only the
end of the tail was visible and marked the
place where he had dug his own grave.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with me, Wolff and my
brother had attacked their opponents and
had forced them to land not far from my
victim.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>We were very happy and flew home and
hoped that the anti-Richthofen Squadron
would often return to the fray.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>


<div class='section'>
<i>We Are Visited By My Father</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>MY father had announced that he would
visit his two sons on the twenty-ninth
of April. My father is commander of
a little town in the vicinity of Lille. Therefore
he does not live very far away from us.
I have occasionally seen him on my flights.</div>

<p>He intended to arrive by train at nine
o'clock. At half past nine he came to our
aerodrome. We just happened to have returned
from an expedition. My brother was
the first to climb out of his machine, and
he greeted the old gentleman with the
words: "Good day, Father. I have just shot
down an Englishman." Immediately after,
I also climbed out of my machine and
greeted him "Good day, Father, I have just
shot down an Englishman." The old gentleman
felt very happy and he was delighted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
That was obvious. He is not one of those
fathers who are afraid for their sons. I
think he would like best to get into a machine
himself and help us shoot. We breakfasted
with him and then we went flying
again.</p>

<p>In the meantime, an aerial fight took
place above our aerodrome. My father
looked on and was greatly interested. We
did not take a hand in the fight for we were
standing on the ground and looked on ourselves.</p>

<p>An English squadron had broken through
and was being attacked above our aerodrome
by some of our own reconnoitering aeroplanes.
Suddenly one of the machines
started turning over and over. Then it recovered
itself and came gliding down normally.
We saw, with regret this time, that it
was a German machine.</p>

<p>The Englishman flew on. The German
aeroplane had apparently been damaged. It
was quite correctly handled. It came down
and tried to land on our flying ground. The
room was rather narrow for the large machine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Besides, the ground was unfamiliar
to the pilot. Hence, the landing was not
quite smooth. We ran towards the aeroplane
and discovered with regret that one
of the occupants of the machine, the machine
gunner, had been killed. The spectacle
was new to my father. It made him
serious.</p>

<p>The day promised to be a favorable one
for us. The weather was wonderfully clear.
The anti-aircraft guns were constantly
audible. Obviously, there was much aircraft
about.</p>

<p>Towards mid-day we flew once more.
This time, I was again lucky and shot down
my second Englishman of the day. The Governor
recovered his good spirits.</p>

<p>After the mid-day dinner I slept a little. I
was again quite fresh. Wolff had fought the
enemy in the meantime with his group of
machines and had himself bagged an enemy.
Sch&auml;fer also had eaten one. In the afternoon
my brother and I accompanied by Sch&auml;fer,
Festner and Allmenr&ouml;der flew twice
more.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The first afternoon flight was a failure.
The second was all the better. Soon after
we had come to the front a hostile squadron
met us. Unfortunately they occupied a
higher altitude so we could not do anything.
We tried to climb to their level but did not
succeed. We had to let them go.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>We flew along the front. My brother was
next to me, in front of the others. Suddenly
I noticed two hostile artillery fliers approaching
our front in the most impertinent
and provocative manner. I waved to my
brother and he understood my meaning. We
flew side by side increasing our speed. Each
of us felt certain that he was superior to the
enemy. It was a great thing that we could
absolutely rely on one another and that was
the principal thing. One has to know one's
flying partner.</p>

<p>My brother was the first to approach his
enemy. He attacked the first and I took care
of the second. At the last moment I quickly
looked round in order to feel sure that there
was no third aeroplane about. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
alone and could see eye to eye. Soon I had
got on the favorable side of my opponent. A
short spell of quick firing and the enemy machine
went to pieces. I never had a more
rapid success.</p>

<p>While I was still looking where my enemy's
fragments were falling, I noticed my
brother. He was scarcely five hundred yards
away from me and was still fighting his opponent.</p>

<p>I had time to study the struggle and must
say that I myself could not have done any
better than he did. He had rushed his man
and both were turning around one another.
Suddenly, the enemy machine reared. That
is a certain indication of a hit. Probably the
pilot was shot in the head. The machine
fell and the planes of the enemy apparatus
went to pieces. They fell quite close to my
victim. I flew towards my brother and we
congratulated one another by waving. We
were highly satisfied with our performance
and flew off. It is a splendid thing when one
can fly together with one's brother and do
so well.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime, the other fellows of the
squadron had drawn near and were watching
the spectacle of the fight of the two
brothers. Of course they could not help us,
for only one man can shoot down an opponent.
If one airman has tackled his enemy
the others cannot assist. They can only look
on and protect his back. Otherwise, he
might be attacked in the rear.</p>

<p>We flew on and went to a higher altitude,
for there was apparently a meeting somewhere
in the air for the members of the Anti-Richthofen
Club. They could recognize us
from far away. In the powerful sunlight,
the beautiful red color of our machines could
be seen at a long distance.</p>

<p>We closed our ranks for we knew that our
English friends pursued the same business
as we. Unfortunately, they were again too
high. So we had to wait for their attack.
The celebrated triplanes and Spads were perfectly
new machines. However, the quality
of the box matters little. Success depends
upon the man who sits in it. The English
airmen played a cautious game but would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
not bite. We offered to fight them, either
on one side of the front or on the other. But
they said: No, thank you. What is the good
of bringing out a squadron against us and
then turning tail?<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>At last, one of the men plucked up courage
and dropped down upon our rear machine.
Naturally battle was accepted although
our position was unfavorable. If
you wish to do business you must, after all,
adapt yourself to the desires of your customers.
Therefore we all turned round.
The Englishman noticed what was going on
and got away. The battle had begun.</p>

<p>Another Englishman tried a similar trick
on me and I greeted him at once with quick
fire from my two machine guns. He tried
to escape me by dropping down. That was
fatal to him. When he got beneath me I
remained on top of him. Everything in the
air that is beneath me, especially if it is a
one-seater, a chaser, is lost, for it cannot
shoot to the rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>My opponent had a very good and very
fast machine. However, he did not succeed
in reaching the English lines. I began to
fire at him when we were above Lens. I
started shooting when I was much too far
away. That was merely a trick of mine. I
did not mean so much to hit him as to
frighten him, and I succeeded in catching
him. He began flying curves and this enabled
me to draw near. I tried the same
manoeuver a second and a third time.
Everytime my foolish friend started making
his curves I gradually edged quite close to
him.</p>

<p>I approached him almost to touching distance.
I aimed very carefully. I waited a
moment and when I was at most at a distance
of fifty yards from him I started with
both the machine guns at the same time. I
heard a slight hissing noise, a certain sign
that the benzine tanks had been hit. Then
I saw a bright flame and my lord disappeared
below.</p>

<p>This was the fourth victim of the day.
My brother had bagged two. Apparently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
we had invited our father to a treat. His
joy was wonderful.</p>

<p>I had invited several gentlemen for the
evening. Among these was my dear Wedel
who happened to be in the neighborhood.
We had a great treat. The two brothers
had bagged six Englishmen in a single day.
That is a whole flying squadron.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>I believe the English cease to feel any
sympathy for us.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>


<div class='section'>
<i>I Fly Home</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>I&nbsp; HAD shot down fifty aeroplanes. That
was a good number but I would have
preferred fifty-two. So I went up one day
and had another two, although it was
against orders.</div>

<p>As a matter of fact I had been allowed to
bag only forty-one. Anyone will be able to
guess why the number was fixed at forty-one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Just for that reason I wanted to avoid
that figure. I am not out for breaking records.
Besides, generally speaking, we of the
Flying Corps do not think of records at all.
We merely think of our duty. Boelcke might
have shot down a hundred aeroplanes but
for his accident, and many others of our dear
dead comrades might have vastly increased
their bag but for their sudden death. Still,
it is some fun to have downed half a hundred
aeroplanes. After all, I had succeeded in
obtaining permission to bring down fifty machines
before going on leave.</p>

<p>I hope that I may live to celebrate a second
lot of fifty.</p>

<p>In the evening of that particular day the
telephone bell was ringing. Headquarters
wished to speak to me. It seemed to me the
height of fun to be connected with the holy
of holies.</p>

<p>Over the wire they gave me the cheerful
news that His Majesty had expressed the
wish to make my personal acquaintance and
had fixed the date for me. I had to make
an appearance on the second of May. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
notification reached me on the thirtieth of
April at nine o'clock in the evening. I should
not have been able to fulfil the wish of our
All-Highest War-Lord by taking the train.
I therefore thought I would travel by air,
especially as that mode of locomotion is far
pleasanter. I started the next morning, not
in my single-seater "le petit rouge" but in
a big fat double-seater.</p>

<p>I took a seat at the rear, not at the sticks.
The man who had to do the flying was Lieut.
Krefft, one of the officers of my squadron.
He was just going on furlough to recover
his strength, so that it suited him admirably
to act as my pilot. He reached home more
quickly traveling by air and he preferred
the trip by aeroplane.</p>

<p>I started on the journey rather hastily.
The only luggage which I took with me was
my tooth-brush. Therefore, I had to dress
for the journey in the clothes in which I was
to appear at Headquarters. Now, a soldier
does not carry with him many beautiful
uniforms when he goes to war and the scarcity
of nice clothes is particularly great in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the case of such a poor front hog as myself.</p>

<p>My brother undertook the command of
the aeroplane squadron in my absence. I
took leave with a few words for I hoped soon
to recommence my work among those dear
fellows.</p>

<p>The flight went via Namur, Li&egrave;ge, Aix la
Chapelle and Cologne. It was lovely for
once to sail through the air without any
thoughts of war. The weather was wonderful.
We had rarely had such a perfect
time. Probably the men at the front would
be extremely busy.</p>

<p>Soon our own captive balloons were lost
to sight. The thunder of the Battle of Arras
was only heard in the distance. Beneath us
all was peace. We saw steamers on the
rivers and fast trains on the railways. We
easily overtook everything below. The wind
was in our favor. The earth seemed as flat
as a threshing floor. The beautiful mountains
of the Meuse were not recognizable as
mountains. One could not even trace them
by their shadows, for the sun was right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
above us. We only knew that they were
there and with a little imagination we could
hide ourselves in the cool glades of that delightful
country.</p>

<p>It had become late. Clouds were gathering
below and hid from us the earth. We
flew on, taking our direction by means of
the sun and the compass. The vicinity of
Holland was disagreeable to us. We decided
to go lower in order to find out where we
were. We went beneath the cloud and discovered
that we were above Namur.</p>

<p>We then went on to Aix la Chapelle. We
left that town to our left and about mid-day
we reached Cologne. We both were in high
spirits. We had before us a long leave of
absence. The weather was beautiful. We
had succeeded in all our undertakings. We
had reached Cologne. We could be certain
to get to Headquarters in time, whatever
might happen.</p>

<p>Our coming had been announced in Cologne
by telegram. People were looking out
for us. On the previous day the newspapers
had reported my fifty-second aerial victory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
One can imagine what kind of a reception
they had prepared for us.</p>

<p>Having been flying for three hours I had
a slight headache. Therefore, I thought I
would take forty winks, before going to
Headquarters. From Cologne we flew along
the Rhine for some distance. I knew the
country well. I had often journeyed that
way by steamer, by motor car, and by railway,
and now I was traveling by aeroplane.
It is difficult to say which of these is the
most pleasant form of locomotion. Of
course, one can see the details of the landscape
better from the steamer. However,
the commanding view one gets from an aeroplane
has also its attractions. The Rhine is
a very beautiful river, from above as well
as from any other viewpoint.</p>

<p>We flew rather low in order not to lose
the sensation that we were traveling among
mountains, for after all the most beautiful
part of the Rhine are the tree clad hills and
castles. Of course we could not make out
individual houses. It is a pity that one cannot
fly slowly and quickly. If it had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
possible I would have flown quite slowly.</p>

<p>The beautiful views which we saw vanished
only too quickly. Nevertheless, when
one flies high in the air one never has the
sensation that one is proceeding at a fast
pace. If you are sitting in a motor car or
in a fast train you have the impression of
tremendous speed. On the other hand, you
seem to be advancing slowly when you fly
in an aeroplane at a considerable speed. You
notice the celerity of your progress only
when you have not looked out of your machine
for four or five minutes and then try
to find out where you are. Then the aspect
of the country appears suddenly completely
changed. The terrain which you passed over
a little while ago looks quite different under
a different angle, and you do not recognize
the scenery you have passed. Herein lies
the reason that an airman can easily lose his
way if he forgets for a moment to examine
the territory.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we arrived at Headquarters
and were cordially received by some
comrades with whom I was acquainted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
who worked at the holiest of holies. I absolutely
pitied those poor ink-spillers. They
get only half the fun in war.</p>

<p>First of all I went to the General commanding
the Air Forces.</p>

<p>On the next morning came the great moment
when I was to meet Hindenburg and
Ludendorf. I had to wait for quite a while.</p>

<p>I should find it difficult to describe my
encounter with these Generals. I saw Hindenburg
first and then Ludendorf.</p>

<p>It is a weird feeling to be in the room
where the fate of the world is decided. I
was quite glad when I was again outside
the holiest of holies and when I had been
commanded to lunch with His Majesty. The
day was the day of my birth and somebody
had apparently told His Majesty. He congratulated
me in the first place on my success,
and in the second, on my twenty-fifth
birthday. At the same time he handed me
a small birthday present.</p>

<p>Formerly I would never have believed it
possible that on my twenty-fifth birthday
I would be sitting at the right of General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Field Marshal von Hindenburg and that I
would be mentioned by him in a speech.</p>

<p>On the day following I was to take mid-day
dinner with Her Majesty. And so I
went to Homburg. Her Majesty also gave
me a birthday present and I had the great
pleasure to show her how to start an aeroplane.
In the evening I was again invited
by General Field Marshal von Hindenburg.
The day following I flew to Freiburg to do
some shooting. At Freiburg I made use of
the flying machine which was going to Berlin
by air. In Nuremberg I replenished my
tanks with benzine. A thunderstorm was
coming on. I was in a great hurry to get to
Berlin. Various more or less interesting
things awaited me there. So I flew on, the
thunderstorm notwithstanding. I enjoyed
the clouds and the beastly weather. The
rain fell in streams. Sometimes it hailed.
Afterwards the propeller had the most extraordinary
aspect. The hail stones had
damaged it considerably. The blades looked
like saws.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I enjoyed the bad weather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
so much that I quite forgot to look about
me. When I remembered that one has to
look out it was too late. I had no longer any
idea where I was. That was a nice position
to be in! I had lost my way in my own
country! My people at home would laugh
when they knew it! However, there it was
and couldn't be helped. I had no idea where
I was. Owing to a powerful wind I had
been driven out of my course and off my
map. Guided by sun and compass I tried to
get the direction of Berlin.</p>

<p>Towns, villages, hills and forests were
slipping away below me. I did not recognize
a thing. I tried in vain to compare the
picture beneath my map. Everything was
different. I found it impossible to recognize
the country. Later on I discovered the impossibility
of finding my way for I was flying
about sixty miles outside my map.</p>

<p>After having flown for a couple of hours
my guide and I resolved to land somewhere
in the open. That is always unpleasant.
One cannot tell how the surface of the
ground is in reality. If one of the wheels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
gets into a hole one's box is converted into
matchwood.</p>

<p>We tried to read the name written upon
a station, but of course that was impossible,
it was too small. So we had to land. We
did it with a heavy heart for nothing else
could be done. We looked for a meadow
which appeared suitable from above and
tried our luck. Close inspection unfortunately
showed that the meadow was not as
pleasant as it seemed. The fact was obviously
proved by the slightly bent frame of
our machine. We had made ourselves
gloriously ridiculous. We had first lost our
way and then smashed the machine. So we
had to continue our journey with the commonplace
conveyance, by railway train.
Slowly but surely, we reached Berlin. We
had landed in the neighborhood of Leipzig.
If we had not landed so stupidly, we would
certainly have reached Berlin. But sometimes
you make a mistake whatever you do.</p>

<p>Some days later I arrived in Schweidnitz,
my own town. Although I got there at seven
o'clock in the morning, there was a large
crowd at the station. I was very cordially
received. In the afternoon various demonstrations
took place to honor me, among
others, one of the local Boy Scouts.</p>

<p>It became clear to me that the people at
home took a vivid interest in their fighting
soldiers after all.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a><br /><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>




<h2>XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><i>My Brother</i></div>


<div class='cap'>I&nbsp; HAD not yet passed eight days of my
leave when I received the telegram:
"Lothar is wounded but not mortally." That
was all. Inquiries showed that he had been
very rash. He flew against the enemy,
together with Allmenr&ouml;der. Beneath him
and a good distance on the other side of the
front, he saw in the air a lonely Englishman
crawling about. He was one of those hostile
infantry fliers who make themselves particularly
disagreeable to our troops. We
molest them a great deal. Whether they
really achieve anything in crawling along
the ground is very problematical.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></div>

<p>My brother was at an altitude of about
six thousand feet, while the Englishman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
was at about three thousand feet. He
quietly approached the Englishman, prepared
to plunge and in a few seconds was
upon him. The Englishman thought he
would avoid a duel and he disappeared likewise
by a plunge. My brother, without hesitation,
plunged after. He didn't care at all
whether he was on one side of the front or
the other. He was animated by a single
thought: I must down that fellow. That is,
of course, the correct way of managing
things. Now and then I myself have acted
that way. However, if my brother does not
have at least one success on every flight he
gets tired of the whole thing.</p>

<p>Only a little above the ground my brother
obtained a favorable position towards the
English flier and could shoot into his shop
windows. The Englishman fell. There was
nothing more to be done.</p>

<p>After such a struggle, especially at a low
altitude, in the course of which one has so
often been twisting and turning, and circling
to the right and to the left, the average mortal
has no longer the slightest notion of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
position. On that day it happened that the
air was somewhat misty. The weather was
particularly unfavorable. My brother quickly
took his bearings and discovered only then
that he was a long distance behind the front.
He was behind the ridge of Vimy. The
top of that hill is about three hundred feet
higher than the country around. My
brother, so the observers on the ground reported,
had disappeared behind the Vimy
height.</p>

<p>It is not a particularly pleasant feeling
to fly home over enemy country. One is
shot at and cannot shoot back. It is true,
however, that a hit is rare. My brother approached
the line. At a low altitude one
can hear every shot that is fired, and firing
sounds then very much like the noise made
by chestnuts which are being roasted. Suddenly,
he felt that he had been hit. That
was queer to him.</p>

<p>My brother is one of those men who cannot
see their own blood. If somebody else
was bleeding it would not impress him very
greatly, but the sight of his own blood upsets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
him. He felt his blood running down
his right leg in a warm stream. At the same
time, he noticed a pain in his hip. Below
the shooting continued. It followed that he
was still over hostile ground.</p>

<p>At last the firing gradually ceased. He
had crossed the front. Now he must be
nimble for his strength was rapidly ebbing
away. He saw a wood and next to the wood
a meadow. Straight for the meadow he flew
and mechanically, almost unconsciously, he
switched off the engine. At the same moment
he lost consciousness.</p>

<p>My brother was in a single-seater. No
one could help him. It is a miracle that he
came to the ground, for no flying machine
lands or starts automatically. There is a
rumor that they have at Cologne an old
Taube which will start by itself as soon as
the pilot takes his seat, which makes the
regulation curve and which lands again after
exactly five minutes.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Many men pretend to
have seen that miraculous machine. I have
not seen it. But still I am convinced that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
tale is true. Now, my brother was not in
such a miraculous automatic machine.
Nevertheless he had not hurt himself in
landing. He recovered consciousness only
in hospital, and was sent to Douai.</p>

<p>It is a curious feeling to see one's brother
fighting with an Englishman. Once I saw
that Lothar, who was lagging behind the
squadron, was being attacked by an English
aviator. It would have been easy for him
to avoid battle. He need only plunge. But
he would not do that. That would not even
occur to him. He does not know how to
run away. Happily I had observed what
was going on and was looking for my chance.</p>

<p>I noticed that the Englishman went for
my brother and shot at him. My brother
tried to reach the Englishman's altitude disregarding
the shots. Suddenly his machine
turned a somersault and plunged perpendicularly,
turning round and round. It was
not an intended plunge, but a regular fall.
That is not a nice thing to look at, especially
if the falling airman is one's own brother.
Gradually I had to accustom myself to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
sight for it was one of my brother's tricks.
As soon as he felt sure that the Englishman
was his superior he acted as if he had been
shot.</p>

<p>The Englishman rushed after him. My
brother recovered his balance and in a moment
had got above his enemy. The hostile
aeroplane could not equally quickly get
ready for what was to come. My brother
caught it at a favorable angle and a few
seconds after it went down in flames. When
a machine is burning all is lost for it falls to
the ground burning.</p>

<p>Once I was on the ground next to a benzine
tank. It contained one hundred litres
of benzine which exploded and burnt. The
heat was so great that I could not bear to
be within ten yards of it. One can therefore
imagine what it means if a tank containing
a large quantity of this devilish liquid explodes
a few inches in front of one while
the blast from the propeller blows the flame
into one's face. I believe a man must lose
consciousness at the very first moment.</p>

<p>Sometimes miracles do happen. For instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
I once saw an English aeroplane falling
down in flames. The flames burst out
only at an altitude of fifteen hundred feet.
The whole machine was burning. When we
had flown home we were told that one of
the occupants of the machine had jumped
from an altitude of one hundred and fifty
feet. It was the observer. One hundred and
fifty feet is the height of a good sized steeple.
Supposing somebody should jump from its
top to the ground, what would be his condition?
Most men would break their bones
in jumping from a first floor window. At
any rate, this good fellow jumped from a
burning machine at an altitude of one hundred
and fifty feet, from a machine which
had been burning for over a minute, and
nothing happened to him except a simple
fracture of the leg. Soon after his adventure
he made a statement from which it appears
that his nerve had not suffered.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Another time, I shot down an Englishman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
The pilot had been fatally wounded in the
head. The machine fell perpendicularly to
earth from an altitude of nine thousand feet.
Some time later I came gliding down and
saw on the ground nothing but a heap of
twisted debris. To my surprise I was told
that the observer had only damaged his skull
and that his condition was not dangerous.
Some people have luck indeed.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, Boelcke shot down a
Nieuport machine. I was present. The
aeroplane fell like a stone. When we inspected
it we found that it had been driven
up to the middle into the loamy soil. The
occupant had been shot in the abdomen and
had lost consciousness and had wrenched his
arm out of its socket on striking the ground.
He did not die of his fall.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it has happened that
a good friend of mine in landing had a slight
accident. One of the wheels of his machine
got into a rabbit hole. The aeroplane was
traveling at no speed and quite slowly went
on its head. It seemed to reflect whether it
should fall to the one side or to the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
turned over and the poor fellow's back was
broken.</p>

<p>My brother Lothar is Lieutenant in the
4th Dragoons. Before the war he was at
the War Academy. He was made an officer
at the outbreak and began the war as a
cavalry man exactly as I did. I know nothing
about his actions for he never speaks of
himself. However, I have been told the following
story:</p>

<p>In the winter of 1914 Lothar's regiment
was on the Warthe. The Russians were
on the other side of the river. Nobody
knew whether they intended to stay
there or to go back. The water was
frozen partly along the shore. So it
was difficult to ride through the river.
There were, of course, no bridges, for the
Russians had destroyed them. So my
brother swam across, ascertained the position
of the Russians and swam back again.
He did that during a severe Russian winter
when the thermometer was very low. After
a few minutes his clothes were frozen solid.
Yet he asserted that he had felt quite warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
notwithstanding. He kept on his horse all
day long until he got to his quarters in the
evening, yet he did not catch a chill.</p>

<p>In winter, 1915, he followed my urgent
advice and went into the flying service. He
also became an observer and became a pilot
only a year later. Acting as an observer is
certainly not a bad training, particularly for
a chasing airman. In March, 1917, he passed
his third examination and came at once to
my squadron.</p>

<p>When he arrived he was a very young and
innocent pilot who never thought of looping
and such like tricks. He was quite satisfied
if he succeeded in starting his machine and
in landing successfully. A fortnight later I
took him with me against the enemy for the
first time. I asked him to fly close behind
me in order that he might see exactly how
the fighting was done.</p>

<p>After the third flight with him I suddenly
noticed he parted company with me. He
rushed at an Englishman and killed him.
My heart leapt with joy when I saw it. The
event proved once more that there is no art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
in shooting down an aeroplane. The thing
is done by the personality or by the fighting
determination of the airman.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> I am not a
Pegoud and I do not wish to be a Pegoud.
I am only a soldier who does his duty.</p>

<p>Four weeks later my brother had shot
down a total of twenty Englishmen. His
record as a flier is probably unique. It has
probably not happened in any other case
that a pilot, a fortnight after his third examination,
has shot down his first enemy and
that he has shot down twenty during the
first four weeks of his fighting life.</p>

<p>My brother's twenty-second opponent was
the celebrated Captain Ball. He was by far
the best English flier. Major Hawker, who
in his time was as renowned as Captain Ball,
I had pressed to my bosom some months previously.
It was a particular pleasure to me
that it fell to my brother to settle England's
second flying champion.</p>

<p>Captain Ball flew a triplane and encountered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
my brother flying by himself at the
Front. Each tried to catch the other.
Neither gave his opponent a chance. Every
encounter was a short one. They were constantly
dashing at one another. Neither
succeeded in getting behind the other. Suddenly
both resolved to fire a few well aimed
shots during the few moments of the encounter.
Both rushed at one another, and
fired. Both had before them their engine.
The probability of a hit was very small for
their speed was twice as great as normally.
It was improbable that either should succeed.
My brother, who was a little lower,
had pulled his machine around too hard and
the result was that it overturned. For a moment
his aeroplane became unsteerable. But
presently he recovered control and found out
that his opponent had smashed both his benzine
tanks. Therefore, he had to stop the
engine and land quickly. Otherwise, his
machine might burst into flames.</p>

<p>His next idea was: What has become of
my opponent? At the moment when his machine
turned its somersault he had seen that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the enemy's machine was rearing up in the
air and had also turned a somersault. He
therefore could not be very far. His whole
thought was: Is he above me or beneath me?
He was not above but he saw the triplane
falling down in a series of somersaults. It
fell, fell, fell until it came to the ground
where it was smashed to pieces. This happened
on German territory. Both opponents
had hit one another with their machine guns.
My brother's machine had had both benzine
tanks smashed and at the same moment
Captain Ball had been shot through the head.
He carried with him some photographs and
cuttings from the newspapers of his town
where he had been greatly feted.
In Boelcke's time Captain Ball destroyed
thirty-six German machines. He, too, had
found his master. Was it by chance that a
prominent man such as he also should die
an ordinary soldier's death?<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>
<p>Captain Ball was certainly the commander
of the Anti-Richthofen Squadron. I believe
that the Englishmen will now give up their
attempt to catch me. I should regret it, for
in that case, I should miss many opportunities
to make myself beloved by them.</p>

<p>Had my brother not been wounded on the
fifth of May he would probably on my return
from furlough, also have been given a
leave of absence with fifty-two hostile machines
to his credit.</p>

<p>My father discriminates between a sportsman
and a butcher. The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'latter'">former</ins> shoots for
fun. When I have shot down an Englishman
my hunting passion is satisfied for a
quarter of an hour. Therefore I do not
succeed in shooting two Englishmen in succession.
If one of them comes down I have
the feeling of complete satisfaction. Only
much, much later I have overcome my instinct
and have become a butcher.</p>

<p>My brother is differently constituted. I
had an opportunity of observing him when
he was shooting down his fourth and fifth
opponents. We were attacking in a squadron.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
I started the dance. I had settled my
opponent very quickly. When I looked
around I noticed my brother rushing after
an English machine which was bursting into
flames, and exploded. Next to it was another
Englishman. My brother, though following
number one, immediately directed
his machine gun against number two, although
his first opponent was still in the
air and had not yet fallen. His second victim
also fell after a short struggle.</p>

<p>When we met at home he asked me
proudly, "How many have you shot down?"
I said quite modestly, "One." He turned his
back upon me and said, "I did two." Thereupon
I sent him forward to make inquiries.
He was to find out the names of his victims,
etc. He returned late in the afternoon
having been able to find only a single Englishman.</p>

<p>He had looked carelessly, as is usual
amongst such butchers. Only on the following
day I received a report as to the place
where the second had come down.</p>

<p>We all had seen his fall.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>


<div class='section'>
<i>I Shoot a Bison</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>WHEN visiting Headquarters I met the
Prince von Pless. He permitted me to
shoot a bison on his estate. The bison has
died out. On the whole earth there are only
two spots where bisons may be found. These
are the Pless Estate and in the Bialowicz
estate of the ex-Czar. The Bialowicz forest
has, of course, suffered terribly through the
war. Many a magnificent bison which ought
to have been shot either by the Czar or by
some other monarch has been eaten by German
musketeers.</div>

<p>Through the kindness of the Prince I was
permitted to shoot so rare an animal. In a
few decades none will be left.</p>

<p>I arrived at Pless on the afternoon of the
twenty-sixth of May and had to start immediately
from the station if I wished to kill
a bull the same evening. We drove along
the celebrated road, through the giant preserves
of the Prince, which has been frequented
by many crowned heads. After
about an hour, we got out and had to walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
half an hour to come to the shooting place.
The drivers had already been placed in position.
The signal was given to them and they
began the drive.</p>

<p>I stood at an elevated spot which had been
occupied, according to the head forester, by
His Majesty, who from thence had shot
many a bison. We waited some considerable
time. Suddenly I saw among the timber a
gigantic black monster, rolling along. It
came straight in my direction. I noticed it
before the head forester had. I got ready
for firing and must say that I felt somewhat
feverish.</p>

<p>It was a mighty bull. When he was at a
distance of two hundred yards there was
still some hope for him. I thought it was
too far for a shot. Of course I could have
hit the monster because it was impossible
to miss such a huge beast. However, it
would have been unpleasant to search for
him. Besides it would have been ridiculous
had I missed him, so I thought I would wait
until he came nearer.</p>

<p>Probably he noticed the drivers for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
suddenly turned and came rushing towards
me at a sharp angle and at a speed which
seemed to me incredible. It was a bad position
for a shot, and in a moment he disappeared
behind a group of stout trees.</p>

<p>I heard him snorting and stamping. I lost
sight of him. I have no idea whether he
smelt me or not. At any rate, he had disappeared.
I caught another glimpse of him
at a long distance and he was gone.</p>

<p>I do not know whether it was the unaccustomed
aspect of the animal or whether
something else affected me. At any rate, at
the moment when the bull came near I had
the same feeling, the same feverishness
which seizes me when I am sitting in my
aeroplane and notice an Englishman at so
great a distance that I have to fly perhaps
five minutes in order to get near him. The
only difference is that the Englishman defends
himself. Possibly, different feelings
would have moved me had I been standing
on level ground and not on an elevated
position.</p>

<p>Before long, a second bison came near.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
He was also a huge fellow. He made it
easier for me to fire my shot. At a distance
of eighty yards I fired at him but I had
missed my opportunity to shoot him in the
shoulder. A month before, Hindenburg had
told me when talking of bison: "You must
take a lot of cartridges with you. I have
spent on such a fellow half a dozen for he
does not die easily. His heart lies so deep
that one misses it as a rule." That was
really so. Although I knew exactly where
the bison's heart was I had missed it. I fired
a second shot and a third. Hit for the third
time the bull stopped perhaps fifty yards
from me.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the beast was dead.
The shooting was finished. All three bullets
had hit him close above the heart.</p>

<p>We drove now, past the beautiful hunting
box of the Prince through the forest, in
which the guests of Prince Pless shoot
every year, deer, and other animals. Then
we looked at the interior of the house in
Promnitz. It is situated on a peninsula. It
commands beautiful views and for three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
miles around there is no human being. One
has no longer the feeling that one is in a
preserve of the ordinary kind when one visits
the estate of Prince Pless, for the preserve
extends to a million acres. It contains glorious
stags which have never been seen by
man. No forester knows them. Occasionally
they are shot. One can tramp about for
weeks without seeing a bison. During certain
times of the year it is impossible to find
one. They like quietude and they can hide
themselves in the gigantic forests and
tangled woods. We saw many beautiful
deer.</p>

<p>After about two hours we arrived at Pless,
just before it became dark.</p>

<i>Infantry Fliers, Artillery Fliers<br />

</div>

<div class='cap'>HAD I not become a professional chaser
I should have turned an infantry flier.
After all, it must be a very satisfactory feeling
to be able to aid those troops whose
work is hardest. The infantry flier can do
a great deal to assist the man on foot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
For that reason his is a very grateful task.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></div>

<p>In the course of the Battle of Arras I observed
many of these splendid fellows. They
flew in any weather and at any time at a
low altitude over the enemy and tried to
act as connecting links with our hard-pressed
troops. I can understand that one
can fight with enthusiasm when one is given
such a task. I dare say many an airman has
shouted Hurrah! when, after an assault he
saw the hostile masses stream back or when
our smart infantry leaped from the trenches
and fought the aggressors eye to eye. Many
a time, after a chasing expedition, I have
fired my remaining cartridges into the
enemy trenches. Although I may have done
little practical good, such firing affects the
enemy's morale.</p>

<p>I have also been an artillery flier. In my
time it was a novelty to regulate the firing
of one's own artillery by wireless telegraphy.
To do this well an airman requires special
talent. I could not do the work for long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
I prefer fighting. Very likely, artillery
officers make the best artillery fliers. At
least, they have the necessary knowledge of
the arm which they serve.</p>

<p>I have done a lot of reconnoitering by
aeroplane, particularly in Russia during the
war of movement. Then I acted once more
as a cavalryman. The only difference was
that I rode a Pegasus made of steel. My
days spent with friend Holck among the
Russians were among the finest in my life.</p>

<p>In the Western theater the eye of the
reconnaissance flier sees things which are
very different from those to which the cavalrymen
get accustomed. Villages and
towns, railways and roads seem lifeless and
dead. Yet there is a colossal traffic going on
all the time, but it is hidden from the flying
men with great skill. Only a wonderfully
trained practised and observant eye can
see anything definite when one is traveling
at a great height and at a terrific speed. I
have excellent eyes but it seems doubtful to
me whether there is anyone who can see
anything definite when he looks down upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
road from an altitude of fifteen thousand
feet. As the eye is an imperfect object for
observation one replaces it by the photographic
apparatus. Everything that seems
important to one must be photographed.
Besides, one must photograph those things
which one is told to photograph. If one
comes home and if the plates have gone
wrong, the whole flight has been for nothing.</p>

<p>It often happens to flying men who do
reconnoitering that they get involved in a
fight. However, their task is more important
than fighting. Frequently a photographic
plate is more valuable than the
shooting down of a squadron. Hence the
flying photographer should, as a rule, not
take a hand in fighting.</p>

<p>Nowadays it is a difficult task to reconnoiter
efficiently in the West.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>


<div class='section'>
<i>The German Flying Machines</i><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>IN the course of the War the German flying
machines have experienced great
changes. That is probably generally known.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
There is a colossal difference between a
giant plane and a chaser plane.</div>

<p>The chaser plane is small, fast, quick at
turning. It carries nothing apart from the
pilot except machine guns and cartridges.</p>

<p>The giant plane is a colossus. Its only
duty is to carry as much weight as possible
and it is able to do this owing to the huge
surface of its planes. It is worth while to
look at the gigantic English plane which
landed smoothly on the German side of the
front.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The giant plane can carry an unbelievable
weight. It will easily fly away
dragging from three to five tons. Its benzine
tanks look as large as railroad cars. In
going about in such a colossus one has no
longer the sensation that one is flying. One
is driving. In going about in a giant plane
the direction depends no longer on one's instinct
but on the technical instruments which
one carries.</p>

<p>A giant plane has a huge number of horse
powers. I do not know exactly how many,
but they are many thousand. The greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the horse power is, the better. It seems not
impossible that the day may come when a
whole division will be transported in such
a thing. In its body one can go for a walk.
In one of its corners there is an indescribable
something. It contains an apparatus for
wireless telephony by means of which one
can converse with the people down below.
In another corner are hanging the most
attractive liver sausages which one can imagine.
They are the famous bombs which
cause such a fright to the good people down
below. At every corner is a gun. The whole
thing is a flying fortress, and the planes
with their stays and supports look like
arcades. I have never been able to feel enthusiasm
for these giant barges. I find them
horrible, unsportsmanlike, boring and clumsy.
I rather like a machine of the type of
"le petit rouge."</p>

<p>If one is in a small chaser-plane it is quite
immaterial whether one flies on one's back,
whether one flies up or down, stands on
one's head, etc. One can play any tricks one
likes, for in such a machine one can fly like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
a bird. The only difference is that one does
not fly with wings, as does the bird albatros.
The thing is, after all, merely a flying
engine. I think things will come to this,
that we shall be able to buy a flying suit for
half-a-crown. One gets into it. On the one
end there is a little engine, and a little propeller.
You stick your arms into planes and
your legs into the tail. Then you will do
a few leaps in order to start and away you
will go up into the air like a bird.</p>

<p>My dear reader, I hear you laughing at
my story. But we do not know yet whether
our children will laugh at it. Everyone
would have laughed fifty years ago if somebody
had spoken about flying above Berlin.
I remember the sensation which was caused,
when, in 1910, Zeppelin came for the first
time to Berlin. Now no Berlin street man
looks up into the air when an airship is
coming along.</p>

<p>Besides giant planes and little chaser-planes,
there are innumerable other types of
flying machines and they are of all sizes.
Inventiveness has not yet come to an end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Who can tell what machine we shall employ
a year hence in order to perforate the atmosphere?</p>

given up as a flying machine owing to its slow speed and clumsiness
in manoeuvre and used in its later developments for night-bombing
only.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> This apparently refers to an auto-lock arrangement on the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> A literal translation of the German slang, analogous more or

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> From this disposition of the air-screws, and from the date of
the occurrence, one assumes that this was one of the very earliest
twin-engined Gothas, of the type which the R. F. C. nicknamed
"Wong-wong," because of the curious noise made by the engines or
air-screws when they ran out of step.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Still another example of slang, indicative of the clumsiness of

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> It was also the British custom to ignore&mdash;as part of the score&mdash;all

independent witnesses.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Possibly a very early example of the Riesenflugzeug type,
which is the next biggest thing to the Grossflugzeug type, which
includes the Gothas, A. E. G.'s, Friedrichshafens, and other of the
twin-engined types.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> It is not clear whether this refers to a gun pointing upwards,
as guns at that time were commonly fitted on the upper plane of the
Nieuport, or whether the gun fired through the air-screw. Probably
the latter fitting is meant. Later on one reads that he was
then flying an Albatros, so it may have been a top gun.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Note.&mdash;This book was written after Captain von Richthofen
had brought down fifty-two aeroplanes. At the time of his death
he was officially credited with eighty victories.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Probably this means a patrol of one or two flights&mdash;of four
machines each. One does not recall a whole squadron disappearing
at once, though one or two squadrons had their whole personnel
renewed one or two at a time in the course of a month or so.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> This is the first reference to the regular "Traveling Circus"
idea, in which the whole squadron works as a self-contained unit,
with a special train to move its material, stores, spares, and mechanics,
from place to place, and also provides living accommodations
for the pilots.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The German C-type machines are the two-seater reconnaissance
types. The D-type are the single-seater fighters or "chaser" machines.
The G-type are the big three-seater bombers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> It is interesting to find a German joking about food scarcity
in 1916, exactly as people in England joke about it in 1918. One
is able thus to form some idea of the comparative states of the
two countries, and to judge how Germany would have fared if the
British blockage had been rigidly enforced at the beginning of
the war.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> It was 150 horsepower in 1916. By the beginning of 1918 all
modern German C-type machines had 260 h.p., and by April, 1918,
German biplanes with 500 h.p. in one engine were beginning to
appear. In consequence the extreme height (or "ceiling") of a
C-type machine had risen from 12,000 feet to 20,000 feet.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Attacks on troops on roads by low-flying aeroplanes were not
regularly organized acts of war in those days, though such attacks
had been made by R. N. A. S. pilots in Belgium in 1914. It is
curious that despite the observed effects of the R. N. A. S. attacks,
and the experiences of such men as von Richthofen, neither the
British nor the German aeronautical authorities ever took the
trouble to devote attention to this new method of war. The racial
similarity of the two belligerents is marked in this as in other
matters.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> This locates almost exactly the date of the formation of the
first Boelcke Circus.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Cambrai at that time was a long way behind the front, and
Bapaume was a more important mark for the British squadrons.
So it may not have been worth while for squadrons to go so far
afield as Cambrai. Single machines on long reconnaissance visited
Cambrai regularly.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> This testimony to the improvement in the aerial equipment of
the British Army is well worthy of note.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> This is evidently a junior Immelmann of Boelcke's squadron,
and not the famous Immelmann, who was already dead before the
Boelcke squadron came into existence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> Major Hawker was flying a de Havilland II with a 100 h.p.
Monosoupape Gnome engine, a species of "box-kite" single-seater
biplane, albeit very fast and handy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> One gathers that this account is substantially correct. The
other two British machines who were with Major Hawker became
involved with von Richthofen's four followers and with five other
German chasers which came into the fight from a higher altitude.
These two, after a busy time, fought their way out, while Major
Hawker was fighting von Richthofen. The only flaw in the story
is that in fact one of the upper German machines dived onto
Major Hawker, who, apparently, in avoiding it, came into action
with von Richthofen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> This incident confirms the impression that the small Albatros
biplanes are difficult to land except in a properly prepared aerodrome.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Except when faced by pilots in approximately equal numbers
and equally mounted. It is interesting here to recall the dictum of
General von Hoppner, the chief of the German Flying Service, who
said that the English are dangerous opponents and show by their
fighting spirit that they are of Germanic race. It will be noticed
that von Richthofen repeats the sentiment later on.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> The reference is to what are called "tracer" bullets. The hind
end of the bullet contains a phosphorous mixture which leaves
a trail of smoke and so indicates to the gunner where his bullets
are going. If such a bullet penetrates a petrol tank or passes
through escaping petrol&mdash;due to a perforated tank or a cut petrol-pipe&mdash;it
sets the petrol on fire, but the prime reason is to trace the
course of the shot. The Germans use similar bullets as largely as
do the Allies.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> This is a mistaken idea, common to many pilots who are not
motor engineers. Fire in such cases is caused by petrol or petrol
vapor being set alight by a spark from the magneto, which because
the air-screw is still revolving continues to generate sparks internally
even when switched off. A mere red-hot pipe in an engine
would not cause petrol fire.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> Voss was afterwards shot in a fight by the late Lieut. Rhys-Davids,
D. C. O., M. C. In this fight, which is said to have been
one of the most gallant actions in the war, Voss was flying a
Fokker triplane with a French le Rhone engine, taken out of a
captured machine. He was attacked by six British S. E.'s, all
faster than he was. His solitary companion, on an Albatros, was
shot down at the first onset, but Voss, instead of getting away,
as he could have done, stayed and fought the crowd. His manoeuvering
and shooting are said to have been wonderful. Every British
machine was hit, but none was brought down, and Voss himself
finally fell to a direct attack by Rhys-Davids.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> It is well to note how often von Richthofen refers to the wind
being in his favor. A west wind means that while the machines are
fighting they are driven steadily over the German lines. Then,
if the British machine happens to be inferior in speed or manoeuverability
to the German, and is forced down low, the pilot has the
choice only of fighting to a finish and being killed, or of landing
and being made prisoner. The prevalence of west winds has, for
this reason, cost the R. F. C. a very great number of casualties in
killed and missing, who, if the fight had occurred over territory
held by the British, would merely have landed till the attacking
machine had taken itself off. For similar reasons, the fact that
the R. F. C. has always been on the offensive, and so has always
been flying over the German lines has caused many casualties.
Under all the circumstances it is surprising that the R. F. C. casualties
have not been a great deal heavier.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> Sch&auml;fer was also shot by Lieut. Rhys-Davids, R. F. C., later
in 1917.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> It is possible that the figures are correct. Early in 1917,
before the advent of the British fighters and de Havillands in
quantities, the R. F. C. was having a very bad time. On April 7,
for example, it was reported in the G. H. Q. Communiqu&eacute; that
twenty-eight English machines were missing.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> This might be a useful hint to some people who like to build
repair depots, or big bombing aerodromes, right alongside the
sea a few miles behind the firing line, so that they may be easily
located after the shortest possible flight by the most inexperienced
bombing pilot.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> One assumes that the reference is to the ancient F. E. 2b.
"pusher" biplane, which, though produced in 1915, was still used
for night bombing up till well on in 1918.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_34_34" id="Footnote_34_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> This description is typical of what these extraordinary night-flying
pilots do with their ancient "flying pianos" night after
night, when the weather is reasonable. Von Richthofen's generous
admiration is thoroughly well deserved.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_35" id="Footnote_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> One can find no trace of any deliberate attempt to organize
an anti-Richthofen Circus in the R. F. C., and therefore one
assumes that these were merely three gallant lads on new type
Spads who went out deliberately on their own account to look for
trouble, and found more than they expected.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_36" id="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> This appears to be the first admission that the newer British
machines could out-climb the famous Albatros chasers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> The probability is that the British machines being high up,
and watching the sky all round, did not notice the little red
machines against the dark ground below them for some time.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_38" id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> A whole squadron is eighteen machines, divided into three
"flights" of six machines each. The word squadron does not,
apparently, translate exactly into German.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> Nevertheless, some months after this, a young British pilot
was being entertained one evening by his squadron in celebration
of his having been awarded the D. S. O., and when called upon
for a speech proposed the health of von Richthofen. And the squadron
duly honored the toast.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40_40" id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> Probably the fighting to the east of Amiens in March and
April, 1918, has demonstrated to the German Army at large that
quite a great deal is achieved by this "crawling along the ground."
The use of aeroplanes against infantry and cavalry has been
developed very greatly since von Richthofen wrote his notes
in 1917.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_41" id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> Curiously enough there is a very similar legend concerning
an aged school machine at one of the British flying schools.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42_42" id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> On two or three occasions pilots have gallantly stuck to their
controls and have managed to land safely in blazing machines from
fully 1,000 feet. There is a general opinion that it is possible to fit a
parachute so that in the event of an aeroplane catching fire the
pilot and passenger can quit it at once and descend safely.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_43_43" id="Footnote_43_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> This may be the propagandist editor at work, or it may be a
deliberate attempt to mislead, because, as a matter of fact, a man
cannot survive long as a fighting pilot unless he is a perfect
master of his machine.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_44_44" id="Footnote_44_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> There is some curious error here, for Captain Ball was not
flying a triplane at the time of his death. It seems probable that
someone else shot Captain Ball on the same day, and that, as the
younger von Richthofen was disabled, and so could not go and
identify the wreckage of Captain Ball's machine, the credit was
given to von Richthofen in default of anyone else making a claim.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_45_45" id="Footnote_45_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> This was evidently written some time after von Richthofen's
